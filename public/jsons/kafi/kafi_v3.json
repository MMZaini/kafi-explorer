It is because Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says, “Wash your faces.” From this we learn that one must wash the whole face. He (Allah) then has said, “And (wash) your hands upto (from) the elbows.” He (Allah) then has placed a disjointing in the statement saying, “You must wipe with.of your heads.” From His saying, “With/of your heads” we learn that wiping is only for a portion of the head because of His use of (Arabic letter) al-Ba’ (which means, “with” or “of”). He then has joined (the case of) the feet with that of the head. He has joined the rule of hands with the face, saying, “. . . and your feet up to the ankles” from which we learn that since He has joined it (wiping of feet) with the case of the head, wiping (of the feet) is also for certain portions of it. The Messenger of Allah explained it to people but they lost it. He (Allah) then says, “If you cannot find water, take a Tayammum with clean soil. Wipe your faces and hands therewith.” (5:6) Since He (Allah) has set aside Wudu’ in case you cannot find water He has established wiping (of face partially) as substitute for washing. He has said, “Wipe with/of your faces” and then has joined it with the expression, “and (wipe) your hands” and thereafter has said, “therewith” that is the soil. It is because He (Allah) knows that all of it (soil) does not go to the face. Some of the soil remains attached to certain parts of the palm and not to the other parts.

This applies when you are still taking Wudu’, but when you complete Wudu’, stand up and move to another condition such as Salah (prayer) or something else, and then doubt about something which Allah, most High has mentioned or has made obligatory on you as part of Wudu’, then there is nothing necessary for you to do.

If you become certain that your Wudu’ is left incomplete, you must return to complete that which you are certain is left incomplete.’ Hammad has said that Hariz said that Zurarah has said, ‘I asked him (the Imam) about a man who has left out a certain part of his forearm or a certain part of his body for Ghusl (bath) because of sexual relation.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If one doubts so and there is still moisture on him when he is in his Salah (prayer), he must wipe that part. If he becomes certain of a part being left incomplete, he must go back to complete it by pouring water on the part which is left dry and is without moisture. If one doubts while he has already assumed another condition, he must proceed to his Salah (prayer). There is nothing necessary for him to do about it.

He (the Imam) said, ‘It is obligatory, regardless, if one is on a journey or at home except that women are exempt on a journey due to scarcity of water.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Ghusl (bath) because of sexual relation is obligatory as well as because of Hayd (menses) when bleeding stops. It is obligatory for al-Mustahazah (irregular Hayd (menses)) if blood passes through the piece of cotton, which (she has) placed in her urethra. In such case she must take Ghusl (bath) for every two Salah (prayer) and for the morning Salah (prayer). If blood does not pass through the piece of cotton, there is once Ghusl (bath) only every day and Wudu’ for every Salah (prayer). Ghusl (bath) is obligatory because of al-Nifas (childbirth). Ghusl (bath) of newborn is obligatory. Ghusl (bath) of a dead body is obligatory. There is Ghusl (bath) for visiting (al-Ka‘bah), for entering the House, and for pleading for rainfall. It is preferable to take Ghusl (bath) in the first night of the month of Ramadan. Ghusl (bath) in twenty-first and twenty-third nights of the month of Ramadan is Sunnah that one should not ignore because one of them is the night of al- Qadr.

He brought water and he (’Amir al-Mu’minin) poured with his right hand onto his left hand and said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah who has made water purifying and has not made it impure.’ He then used water to clean his private parts and said, ‘O Lord, protect my private parts and keep them chaste, cover the parts of my body to be concealed and save them from the fire.’ He then cleansed his nostrils and said, ‘O Lord, do not deprive me of the fragrance of paradise; make me of those who enjoy the fragrance, goodness and delight of paradise.’ He then rinsed his mouth and said, ‘O Lord, allow my tongue to speak of You and make me of those with whom You are happy.’ He then washed his face and said, ‘O Lord, make my face white on the Day when faces turn black and do not make my face black on the Day when faces turn white.’ He then washed his right hand and said, ‘O Lord, please give the book of the record of my deeds in my right hand and eternity in my left hand.’ He then washed his left hand and said, ‘O Lord, do not give the book of the record of my deeds in my left hand and do not chain it to my neck. I seek protection with You against the cutting sections of hell.’ He then wiped his head and said, ‘O Lord, cover me up with Your mercy, blessings and forgiveness.’ He then wiped his feet and said, ‘O Lord, keep my foot firm on the bridge on the Day when feet slip and make my deeds gain Your happiness in my favor.’ He then turned to Muhammad and said, ‘O Muhammad, if one takes Wudu’ the way I did and says what I said, Allah creates from every drop of water an angel who glorifies, says Tasbih, Takbir and Tahlil of Allah and the reward for this is written in favor of the person taking Wudu’.’” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Mahbub from ibn Ri’ab from Muhammad ibn Qays who has said the following: “I heard abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say while speaking to people in Makkah, ‘One day the Messenger of Allah completed his Salah (prayer) of the morning and sat in the Masjid with his companions until sunrise. Thereafter, people one by one left the Masjid except two men, one from the people of Ansar and the other from Thaqif. The Messenger of Allah then said to them, “I understand you need to ask me questions. You may ask if you like and I will answer. If you like, I can tell you what your questions are before you ask. If you wish, you may ask me.” They said, “Please inform us before we ask you our questions; it is more enlightening, frees us from doubts and strengthens our belief more.” The Messenger of Allah then said, “You, gentleman from Thaqif, have come to ask me about your Wudu’ and Salah (prayer) regarding what is good for you in them. You should keep in mind that when you place your hand in your water container and say ‘In the name of Allah’ the sins that your hands may have committed scatter away from you. The sins that your eyes and mouth may have committed scatter away from you when you wash your face. When you wash your arms to your elbows, the sins from your left and right scatter away from you. When you wipe your head and feet the sins into which you may have walked scatter away from you. This is what you gain from your Wudu’.’”” ",

This is because when a woman experiences Hayd (menses) it is of a greater amount and it takes ten days. It continues and as time passes and she grows older, the duration of her Hayd (menses) reduces to three days. In this condition it does not go higher and it is not less than three days.  “During her experiencing Hayd (menses) within the date of her Hayd (menses) she must stop performing Salah (prayer). If blood discharge continues for three days it counts as her period of Hayd (menses); but if blood discharge stops within a day or two, she must take Ghusl (bath) and perform her Salah (prayer). She then waits for ten days from the first day blood discharge had started. If she experiences blood discharge within that period of ten days for one or two days to complete three days, then what she had experienced before along with this one within ten days all are of her Hayd (menses). If however, for ten days after the first day she experienced blood discharge she does not experience any blood discharge, then one or two days of blood discharge is not of Hayd (menses). Such discharge can happen because of her internal problems, such as an injury or from internal problems. She must redo her Salah (prayer) missed during such one or two days in which she had stopped performing Salah (prayer). If blood discharge continues for three days, it then is Hayd (menses), which is the minimum duration of Hayd (menses). It is not necessary to perform Salah (prayer) as remedy for those missed during experiencing menses. The duration of the period free of menses is not less than ten days. If she experiences blood discharge for five days then blood discharge stops, she must take Ghusl (bath) and perform her Salah (prayer). If she experiences blood discharge after this and before ten days from theday blood discharge had stopped this as well is of her menses, and during such time she stops performing her Salah (prayer). If she experiences blood discharge which begins from the end of ten days that she had already experienced and it continues for several more days above the first ten days and the second discharge it (that which is above ten days) is of Istihadah (irregular menses) during which she follows the rules about Istihadah (irregular menses).’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Blood discharge, during her established period of menses, of yellow or red color is of menses and whatever discharge takes place after the duration of her menses is not of Hayd (menses).’” ",

If there is thick dark color blood, even of the size of the head of a fly, on the tip of the piece of cotton, her Hayd (menses) has not stopped; and if there is no blood on the tip of cotton, she must take Ghusl (bath) and perform Salah (prayer).’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Isa have narrated from Yunus from more than one person who have said the following: “They asked abu ’Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about women experiencing Hayd (menses) and the tradition in his time. He (the Imam) said, ‘The Messenger of Allah has established three traditions in which he has explained every difficulty for those who hear and understand them so that no one can say anything of his own opinion about it. 1. “One tradition is about one who experiences Hayd (menses) on certain dates for a known period of time without mix and confusion, but she experiences Istihadah (irregular menses) and blood discharge continues. She knows the dates and number of days of the cycle of her Hayd (menses). A woman called Fatimah bint abu Hubaysh experienced Istihadah (irregular menses) and blood discharge continued. She came to ‘Umm Salamah. She asked the Messenger of Allah about it and he said that she must stop performing Salah (prayer) for a number of days, which is equal to the number of days of her Hayd-free period or the days of her Hayd (menses). He (the Messenger of Allah) said it is a (bleeding) vein. He (the Messenger of Allah) commanded her to take Ghusl (bath) (after passing either one of the two above mentioned number of days, namely, the Hayd (menses) free days or the number of days of her Hayd (menses)) and cover herself by passing her clothes between her legs to the other side and perform Salah (prayer). “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘This is one tradition that the Holy prophet has established for women who know the date of their Hayd (menses) free period without mix and confusion. It is because he (the Messenger of Allah) did not ask how many days. He (the Messenger of Allah) did not say that if it increases above such number of days you are in the state of experiencing Istihadah (irregular menses). He (the Messenger of Allah) established a tradition for her in the case of known dates of more or less number after her knowing it (dates) exactly. In the same way my father gave the fatwa when he was asked about a woman experiencing Istihadah (irregular menses). He (the Imam) said, ‘It is only a (bleeding) vein or a kick of Satan.’ “She must stop performing Salah (prayer) for number of the days which is equal to the days of her Hayd (menses)-free period, then take Ghusl (bath) and Wudu’ for every Salah (prayer). It then was asked, ‘Even if it (blood discharge) is flowing?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes even if it is like flowing.’ “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘This is an explanation of Hadith of the Messenger of Allah, it (the explanation) agrees with the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah. This is the tradition about the one who knows the number of days of her Hayd (menses), not the date but only the number, less or more. 2. “This tradition is for one who experiences Hayd (menses) for a number of days but it becomes confused in terms of the number of days due to increase or decrease in such numbers as well as the exact date every month. The tradition for this kind of case is different from the previous one in which one experiences Hayd (menses) during a known number of days and date of every cycle of menses. It is because Fatimah bint abu Hubaysh came to the Holy prophet saying, ‘I continuously experience Hayd (menses) and do not have any menses-free time.’ The Holy prophet, said, ‘That is not Hayd (menses). It is a (bleeding) vein. When Hayd (menses) comes with greater quantity of blood discharge, you must stop performing Salah (prayer); and when it comes with diminished quantity of bleeding, you must take Ghusl (bath), wash the blood clean and perform Salah (prayer).’ “She would sit in a tub that belonged to her sister and yellowish color would rise over the water. Abu ’Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ’Do you not hear that the Messenger of Allah commanded this woman to do something other than what he (the Messenger of Allah) had commanded the other woman to do.? Do you not see that he (the Messenger of Allah) did not say to her, ‘Stop performing Salah (prayer) during the days of your Hayd (menses) free period,’ but he (the Messenger of Allah) told her, ‘When it comes with increased quantity stop performing Salah (prayer) and when it comes with diminished quantity, take Ghusl (bath) and perform Salah (prayer).’ This explains that the case of this woman is confused in terms of number of days in which she experiences Hayd (menses). She does not know the exact number of days as well as the exact date. Do you not hear her saying, ‘I continuously experience Hayd (menses) and I do not have any Hayd (menses) free condition.’ My father would say that she experienced Hayd (menses) for seven years, so in a lesser time it is a confused condition and mixed one. “For this reason she needed to know the condition of the quantity of blood discharge and its quality in terms of color and so on. Blood discharge because of Hayd (menses) is of distinguishable black color. If she had known the days of her experiencing Hayd (menses) she would not need to know the color of blood discharge; the tradition about Hayd (menses) is that yellowness and thickness and things above this are during the days of Hayd (menses). When such signs are found it is then all Hayd (menses). If the color of blood is black and so on, it all explains that blood discharge of lesser or greater quantity in the days of Hayd (menses) is all Hayd (menses) when the days are exactly known to her. However, if she does not know the exact date and number of days she then needs to know the quantity of blood discharge and changes in its color, and then she stops performing Salah (prayer) accordingly. I do not find the Holy prophet, saying, ‘Sit (wait) for so and so many days and above such days is Istihadah (irregular menses). He (the Messenger of Allah) did not command the other woman in the first case like this. So also my father gave fatwa in a likewise case. Once a woman in our family experienced Hayd (menses) and she asked my father about it. He (my father) said, ‘If you experience a flooding blood discharge, stop performing Salah (prayer). If you experience bleeding-free time even for an hour, take Ghusl (bath) and perform Salah (prayer).’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘I find my father’s answer in this case different from his answer in the case of one experiencing Istihadah (irregular menses) mentioned in the first tradition. Consider his saying, ‘Stop performing Salah (prayer) for a period equal to the days of your discharge free period.’ This is because of the number of days. In this case he has said, ‘If you experience flooding blood discharge’ then stop performing Salah (prayer). In this case he commanded to see the quantity in terms of increase and decrease and changes in its color and his saying, ‘flooding discharge’ is similar to the statement of the Holy prophet, ‘Blood discharge because of Hayd (menses) is of distinguishable black color.’ My father has called it flooding discharge because of its greater quantity and color. “This is the tradition the Holy prophet has established for the case of women whose habit is confused in terms of number of days. The way for such women to know is by learning about the quantity and quality of blood discharge. 3. “He (the Imam) said, ‘The third tradition established for Istihadah (irregular menses) and Hayd (menses) is about women who do not have a set pattern for their Hayd (menses); it is a confused pattern and habit. The tradition in such case is different from the first and second traditions. This is because once a woman called Hamnah bint Jahsh came to the Messenger of Allah and said, ‘I have experienced an intense Hayd (menses).’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘Fill up with cotton.’ She said, ‘It is more intense than can be controlled with cotton. It is flooding.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘Harness it tightly and follow the rules for Hayd (menses), according to the knowledge of Allah, for six or seven days. Thereafter, you must take Ghusl (bath) and fast twenty-three days or twenty-four days, then take Ghusl (bath) for the time of dawn (morning Salah (prayer)), one Ghusl (bath) for al-Dhuhr, then perform al-‘Asr Salah (prayer) quickly and another for al-Maghrib and perform al-’Isha’ prayer quickly thereafter and take one more Ghusl (bath).’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘I can see that he (the Messenger of Allah) has established in this case a tradition which is different from the traditions for the first and second case of Hayd (menses). It is because the commandment of the Messenger of Allah to her is different from those to the other two women. Consider that if the number of days in her case were less than seven and were it five or less the Messenger of Allah would not command her to consider it Hayd (menses) for seven days. Therefore, he (the Messenger of Allah) would end up commanding her to stop performing Salah (prayer) for certain days when she experienced Istihadah (irregular menses) and not Hayd (menses). So also is the case if her Hayd (menses) was for more than seven days like being ten days or more, he (the Messenger of Allah) would end up commanding her to perform Salah (prayer) when she experienced Hayd (menses). Furthermore what it explains is his words to her, “Follow rules of Hayd (menses) in your condition.” “Following rules of Hayd (menses)” is only for a woman who in fact experiences Hayd (menses). Do you not see that he (the Messenger of Allah) did not say to her to follow the rule of Hayd (menses) for a certain number of days. One more fact that explains this is his words, “according to knowledge of Allah” because it was for her, although all things are in the knowledge of Allah, most High. This explains it clearly that she did not have a pattern in the form of known days before, at all. This is the tradition for one who experiences blood discharge for the first time without stop. The maximum for such Hayd (menses) is seven days and the maximum Hayd-free period is twenty-three days until the pattern of her experiencing Hayd (menses) is established which then is followed. All cases of Istihadah (irregular menses) fall under these three traditions. It all falls under these traditions. If the number of days, more or less, are known, she follows the rules for Hayd (menses) and her habits accordingly when there is no other number and dates other than her days. “That her days become confused because of coming earlier or later and the changes of conditions. The tradition in her case is to find about the quantity and quality, like color of blood and so on, follow that she had no experience in terms of days before and she experiences Hayd (menses) for the first time in which case it (Hayd (menses)) is seven days and the Hayd-free period is twenty-three days. If blood discharge continues for several months, she follows the rule every month as explained for her. If blood discharge stops before the seven days or after more than seven days, she then takes Ghusl (bath) as soon as she finds a Hayd-free time and performs Salah (prayer). She continues to follow such rule until the second month to see if it is in the same pattern and habit as the month before and up to two or three cycles of Hayd (menses), then it means that a distinguishable pattern and habit is established for her. She can follow the rules of Hayd (menses) accordingly. She can now ignore other conditions and this becomes her tradition for future if she experiences Istihadah (irregular menses). “Basing establishment of pattern and habit on the grounds of two or three Hayd (menses) cycle is because of the words of the Messenger of Allah to the one who had known the number of her days that said, ‘Stop performing Salah (prayer) in the days (dates) of your Hayd-free days.’ This explains that one Hayd-free period is not enough to establish a pattern and habit. He (the Messenger of Allah) did not say one Hayd-free period. He set it for her to be three Hayd-free periods. The minimum is two cycles of Hayd-free periods or more. “When days and her pattern and habit are confused because of increase or decrease in number of days and the pattern is lost even in terms of quality and color, she then follows the rules according to the quantity of blood discharge. She does not have other traditions to follow except this because of the words of the Messenger of Allah, ‘When blood discharge is increased, stop performing Salah (prayer), and when it decreases take Ghusl (bath).’ Also because of the words of the Messenger of Allah, ‘Blood of Hayd (menses) is distinguishably of black color.’ It is like the statement of my father, ‘When you experience flooding blood discharge.’ If this is not applicable and blood discharge continues, it is Istihadah (irregular menses) when the color of blood is of one kind and one condition, in this case the tradition to follow is seven days (of Hayd (menses)) and twenty-three days of Hayd-free period. It is because her case is like the case of Hamnah who said, ‘Blood discharge from me is flooding.’” ",

He (the Imam) said, ‘She must examine by means of the day to see if it stops before ten days. If it continued after ten days it, then is because of Istihadah (not Hayd (menses).

If she finds blood it is then because of Istihadah. I have organized all of her affairs for you.” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father and a number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid all from Muhammad ibn Khalid from Khalaf ibn Hammad and Ahmad has also narrated from Muhammad ibn Aslam from Khalaf ibn Hammad al-Kufiy who has said the following: “A certain person of our people married a girl who had not experienced menstruation. Blood discharge started after sexual relation and it did not stop for about ten days. Nurses were called to examine and they had different opinions. Certain ones of them said that it is because of Hayd (menses) and others said that it is because of virginity. They then asked scholars of their Fiqh (law), like abu Hanifah and other of their scholars of Fiqh. They said that it is a difficult issue because Salah (prayer) is an obligatory duty. She must take Wudu’, perform Salah (prayer) and keep her husband away until blood discharge stops. If in fact it is because of Hayd (menses), performing Salah (prayer) is not harmful, and if it is because of virginity, she has fulfilled her duty. She followed their instruction. I went that year for Hajj. When we were in Mina I sent someone to abu al-Hassan, Musa ibn Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, and said, pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, we have an issue which is giving us a difficult time. If you will kindly grant us an appointment, we like to present it before you for an answer.’ He (the Imam) sent a message that said, ‘When it becomes quiet, there are less feet walking, and roads become free, you can come by the will of Allah.’ Khalaf has said that at night when people’s coming and going reduced in Mina, I walked to his tent. When I was near his tent, I saw a black figure on the road who asked, ‘Who are you?’ I said, ‘I am one of the pilgrims.’ He asked, ‘What is your name?’ I replied, ‘I am Khalaf ibn Hammad.’ He said, ‘You can go inside and you do not need any more permission, because he (the Imam) had instructed me to wait here to allow you to go inside.’ I then went inside, expressed my greeting of peace to him and he (the Imam) responded to my expressing greeting of peace. He (the Imam) was sitting on the furnishing alone and there was no one in the tent beside him (the Imam). When I was in his presence I asked how he felt and he (the Imam) asked about my conditions and I said, ‘A man who is of your followers has married a girl who had not experienced Hayd (menses). After sexual relation she experienced blood discharge, which did not stop for up to ten days. Nurses examined her and they had different opinions about it. Certain ones among them said that it is because of Hayd (menses) and others said that it is because of virginity. What must she do in such condition?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She must observe piety before Allah. If it is because of Hayd (menses), she must stop performing Salah (prayer) until she is clean from Hayd (menses) and she must keep her husband away. If it is because of virginity, she must observe piety before Allah, must take Wudu’, perform Salah (prayer) and allow her husband to come to her if she so pleases.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘How can she find out what it is so they can follow their duty?’ He (the narrator) has that he (the Imam) looked to the left and right sides in the tent for fear of someone hearing his words. He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam) then leaned toward me and said, ‘O Khalaf, it is the secret of Allah, it is the secret of Allah, you must not publicize it and do not tell it to these people the principles of the religion of Allah. Just agree with what Allah has agreed that they follow their straying. He (the Imam) then formed the figure ninety with his left hand and said, ‘She must place a piece of cotton in her urethra and allow it gently there for a while, then gently take it out. If blood is found as a circle around the piece of cotton, it is because of her virginity; and if blood is found as penetrating (in the center) inside the cotton it is because of Hayd (menses).’ Khalaf has said, ‘I cried because of happiness and when my weeping calmed down, he (the Imam) asked, “What made you weep?”’ I replied, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, no one can give an answer better than your answer.’ He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam) raised his hand to the sky and said, ’By Allah, I only answered you from the Messenger of Allah, from Jibril from Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious.”’ ",

If a pregnant woman finds bleeding during a short time before the date during which she would experience Hayd (menses) or during the date of her Hayd (menses) in that month, it then is because of Hayd (menses). She must stop Salah (prayer) during a time, which is equal to the duration of her Hayd (menses). If bleeding stops before the (duration of her Hayd (menses)), she must take Ghusl (bath), and perform Salah (prayer). If bleeding did not stop before one or two days after the end of such duration in which she used to experience Hayd (menses) she then must take Ghusl (bath) then fill with cotton and tie down herself by passing her clothes between her legs to the other side, perform al-Dhuhr and al-‘Asr Salah (prayer). She then must wait and examine if no bleeding from behind the cotton is found after al-Dhuhr and al-‘Asr Salah (prayers) until al-Maghrib, she must take Wudu’ and perform Salah (prayer) in each time of Salah (prayer) as long as the piece of cotton is not disposed. If cotton is disposed and bleeding is found, she must take Ghusl (bath), but if cotton is disposed and no bleeding is found, she must take Wudu’ and perform Salah (prayer). She is not required to take Ghusl (bath).’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If bleeding emerges outside of the cotton placed inside, like perspiration and does not cease, she must take Ghusl (bath) every day and night three times and fill with cotton, then perform Salah (prayer). She must take Ghusl (bath) for the morning Salah (prayer), then take Ghusl (bath) for al-Dhuhr and al-‘Asr, and then take Ghusl (bath) for al-Maghrib and al-‘Isha’ Salah (prayers).’ He (the Imam) said, ‘A woman experiencing Istihadah (irregular menses) must also follow this procedure.

What must she do for Salah (prayer)? He (the Imam) said, ‘If she finds herself Hayd (menses) free after four steps have passed from noon-time, she only performs al-‘Asr Salah (prayer).

Whichever of these signs you see is enough. When the soul departs the body, it is given the choice again as when in the body but it chooses the life hereafter. He is then washed among those who wash him and is turned side to side among those who turn him side to side. When he is wrapped up in the shroud and is placed on the stretcher, his spirit comes out and begins to walk before the people. The spirits of believing people meet him with greetings of peace and good news of whatever bounties Allah, to whom belongs the Glorious praise, has prepared for him. When he is placed in his grave his spirit is returned to him down to his thighs and is asked of what he knows. If he then comes up with what he knows, that door which the Messenger of Allah had shown to him is opened, light, brightness, coolness, goodness and sweet smelling fragrance comes to him from there.’ The narrator has said that I then asked, ‘What about the strong pressure that grave applies?’ The Imam replied, ‘Never, a thing as such ever happens to believing people. By Allah, this earth feels proud of him saying, “Look, a believing person walks upon me but no believing person walks upon you.” The earth says to him, “I loved you when you walked upon my back and when I love, you can see what I will do for you.” It opens up as far and wide as his eyes can see.’” ",

        "englishText": "4. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Muhammad ibn Sinan from ‘Ammar ibn Marwan from a person who had who has said the following: “I heard abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam say, ‘Only from you, by Allah, it (good deeds) is accepted and only your sins are forgiven. There is nothing between any one of you and bliss, joy and the delight of heart, except the time when the soul reaches here’ - pointing to his throat he continued - ‘and when that time comes the Messenger of Allah, Ali, Gabriel and the angel of death come to visit him. Ali comes near him and says, ‘O Messenger of Allah, this person loved us (Ahl al-Bayt), thus please, love him.’ The Messenger of Allah, then says, ‘O Gabriel, this person loved Allah, His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, thus please love him.’ Gabriel then says, ‘O angel of death, this person loved Allah, His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, thus please love him and be kind to him.’ The angel of death then comes near him and says, ‘O servant of Allah, have you freed your neck (from punishment), acquired the certificate of exoneration (from sins) and established your hold to the greatest source of protection in the worldly life?”’ The Imam then said, ‘Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, then grants him power to say, “Yes, I have done so.’” The angel asks, “What is it?” He replies, “It is (my accepting) the guardianship, the Divine Authority of Ali ibn abu Talib, ‘Alayhi al- Salam .” The angel then says, “You have spoken the truth. Allah has now granted you safety from whatever you feared and all of your wishes that you wanted have come true. There is good news for you along with the virtuous ancestors to be in the company of the Messenger of Allah, Ali and Fatimah, ‘Alayhim al-Salam .” Then he gently separates his soul from his body. Then his shroud is brought from paradise and a special (hunut) perfume in the form of Adhfar Musk. He then is dressed up with that shroud, and that hunut is used. In addition, he is dressed up with a yellow dress of the dresses of paradise. When he is placed in the grave, a door from paradise is opened, through which breeze and fragrance come to him. Thereafter, a space of the distance of one month’s journey is opened in front and on both of his sides. Then it is said to him, “Rest like a bridegroom in his bed with good news of the delightful breeze, fragrance, bountiful paradise and the pleasure of the Lord.” He then visits the family of Muhammad in Rizwan paradise, and is served food and drink with them. He speaks to them in their gatherings until the reappearance of al-Qa’im from Ahl al-Bayt. When al- Qa’im reappears, Allah resurrects them and they come along with him wholeheartedly in groups and formations. The unbelievers at this time become worthless, and disrespectful ones are destroyed but they are very few. People who want the reappearance of Al-Qa’im very quickly vanish and those who believe it (reappearance) is near gain their salvation. For this reason the Messenger of Allah said to Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, “You are my brother and the place for us to meet is the valley of Peace.’” The Imam then said, ‘When it is time for an unbeliever to die, the Messenger of Allah, Ali, Gabriel and the angel of death visit him. Ali comes closer to him and says, “O Messenger of Allah, this person disliked us (Ahl al-Bayt), thus dislike him.” The Messenger of Allah then says, “O Gabriel, this person disliked Allah, His Messenger and the family of His Messenger (Ahl al-Bayt), thus please, dislike him.” Gabriel then says, “O angel of death, this person disliked Allah, His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, thus you should also dislike him and be firm with him.” The angel of death then comes near him and says, “O servant of Allah, have you freed your neck from punishment, acquired the certificate of exoneration from sins and established a secure hold to the source of safety in the worldly life?” He then says, “No.” The angel then says, “O enemy of Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, His anger, punishment and hell await you. Whatever you were afraid of has come upon you”; and then he separates his soul from his body in a very harsh manner. Three hundred devils are then assigned over his soul who spit on his face and torture his soul. When he is placed in his grave a door of the doors of hell, whereby pus and flames enter in his grave, is opened.’” ",

Thereafter, the dead body must be wrapped in the shroud. He (the Imam) said, ‘My father made a will that required me to shroud him with three pieces of cloth. One piece was a gown which was made in Hibrah, one more piece of cloth, and a shirt.’ I then asked, ‘Why did he say it in his will?’ He (the Imam) said that he (the Imam) did it so that people will have no objection. We then prepared a turban for him. We then dug the soil like a cut in the earth for him because his body was of a large frame. He had commanded me to raise the surface of his grave from the ground by about four inches.’ He (the Imam) mentioned that it is good to sprinkle water on the grave.’” ",

It is a narration from him (narrator of previous Hadith) by Muhammad ibn Sinan from ‘Abd Allah al-Kahiliy who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about Ghusl (bath) for a dead body. He (the Imam) said, Turn the bottom of the sole of the dead body’s feet toward al-Qiblah (al-Ka‘bah) which makes the dead body facing al-Qiblah (al-Ka‘bah). Thereafter, soften the joints of the bones of the dead body if possible; if not then leave them alone. First wash the private parts with water mixed with Sidr (berry leaves) and al-Huruz. (saltwort), You must give it three Ghusl (baths). Use plenty of water. Rub the belly of the dead body gently. Turn to the head. Begin with the right side of the beard and head, then the left side of the head, beard and face gently and avoid roughing it up. Wash with softness. Then make it lie down on the left side, so the right side is exposed to you. Wash it from head to the toes and rub gently the back and belly, wash it three times; then turn it on its right side to expose the left side to wash it from the head to the toes; rub its back and belly gently and wash it three times. Reach out to its underarms, arms and shoulder with your hand and make its side clean. Whenever you wash, reach with your hand under his shoulders and the inside of his arms. Thereafter make the dead body lie down on its back; then begin with the private parts with water mixed with camphor and do as you did before. Wash it three times with water mixed with camphor and al-Huruz (saltwort) and rub the belly of the dead body gently. You must then turn to the head and face and do as you did before on both sides, the head and face with water mixed with camphor three times. You must then turn it on its left side, so its right side is exposed. You must then wash it from head to the toes three times. Thereafter you must turn it on its right side to expose its left side. You must then wash it from its head to its toes three times, and push your hand under the shoulder bones of the dead body and arms. The arms and hands must be cleansed along with the sides. Whenever you wash anything, push your hand under the shoulder bones of the dead body and inside of the arms. You must then turn it on its back. You must then wash it with pure water as you did before. You must begin with the private parts, then turn to the head, beard and face to do what you did before with pure water. You must then wrap it with a piece of fabric from the waist down with a great deal of cotton underneath. You must then tie the thighs with a piece of fabric tightly, so nothing can come out. You must not make the dead body sit up or press its belly. You must not fill up the ears with something but if you are afraid of something coming out of the nostrils, you may fill it with cotton; but if you are not afraid do not fill it up with anything. Do not clean underneath the nails of the dead body: and so also is Ghusl (bath) for women.’” ",

Remove his hands from the shirt if any, and pull it down over the private parts. Pull it up above his knees. If shirt is not there, cover his private parts with a piece of fabric. Find Sidr (berry leaves). Place them in a pail and pour water on them. Stir with your hand until foam rises. Remove the foam in something and pour the rest in a container with water. Wash his hands three times, half way up to the elbows, just as one washes them because of sexual relation. Then wash his private parts and clean them. Then wash his head with foam thoroughly and do not allow water to enter his nostrils or ears. Then place him on the platform for Ghusl (bath) on his left side, and pour water on one half of his head down to his toes three times. Rub his body gently as well as his back and belly. Then place him on his right side on the platform for Ghusl (bath). Do as you did with the left side. You must then throw away the water from the water container. You must wash it with pure water and wash your hands up to your elbows. You must then pour water in the pail and place a piece of camphor in it and do as you did before with Sidr (berry leaves). Begin with his hands, then his private parts, then rub his belly gently, and if something comes out, clean it. Then wash his head. Then place him on his left side and wash his right side, his back and belly. Then place him on his right side and wash his left side as you did before. Then wash your hands up to the elbows and the water pail with pure water. Give him Ghusl (bath) with pure water just as you did in the other two Ghusl (bath). Then dry him up with a piece of clean cloth. Then find cotton, spread a certain amount of Hunut (camphor) on it and fill it in his private parts front and back. Fill his buttocks with cotton so that nothing can come out. Then find a long piece of fabric about a foot wide and tie it tightly around him from waist down to his knees by sending one end underneath to the right side, wrapping it around tightly, and push its end underneath the end where it had started tight.’” ",

In the case of a woman, her husband gives her Ghusl (bath) by reaching with his hand under her shirt.”’ ",

Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah has narrated from Ibrahim ibn ‘Ishaq from Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Daylamiy from his father who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that once ‘Abd Allah ibn Qays al-Masir visited abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and said, ‘Tell me why a dead body is given Ghusl (bath) because of carnal activities?’ Abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘I do not want to tell you.’ He then left and thereafter found someone of the followers of the Imam. He said to him, ‘It is very strange of you Shi‘ah people. You consider this man as Divine guardian, obey him even if he asks you to worship him. I asked him a question but he had no answer for it.’ A few days later he visited the Imam again, asked the same question and he (the Imam) said, ‘I do not want to tell you.’ ‘Abd Allah ibn Qays then asked one of his people, ‘Join the Shi‘ah and pretend among them to be one of those who love the Imam. Condemn and denounce me. When it is time to perform Hajj come to me so I pay for your expenses; and then ask them to help you visit him (their Imam) Muhammad ibn Ali. When you are there, then ask him about why a dead person is given Ghusl (bath) because of carnal reasons.’ The man joined the Shi‘ah people until it was time to perform Hajj. During this time, he had observed the religious conditions of these people and had already accepted their belief, but did not tell ibn al-Qays about it for fear of being deprived of performing Hajj. When it was time for Hajj, he went to ibn al-Qays who provided him the expenses for Hajj. When he arrived in al-Madinah, his friends told him to stay behind until they informed the Imam about him and asked him for permission for a meeting. When they went to see abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, he asked them, ‘Where is your companion? You have not treated him with fairness.’ They said, ‘We did not know if you agreed to see him or not.’ He then sent someone to bring him for a meeting. Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, welcomed him. He (the Imam) asked, ‘How do you feel comparing what you have found with what you had before?’ He replied, ‘O child of the Messenger of Allah, I did not have anything.’ He said, ‘You have spoken the truth. Your worships in those days were easier than what they are today; truth is heavy and Satan is assigned to work hard against our Shi ‘ah but other people themselves work for him. I, however, will tell you about the question of al- Qays al-Masir before even you ask me about it and will leave it for you to decide whether to explain it to him or not. Allah, Most High, has created creative agents. When He decides to create a creature, He commands them (agents) to get something from the soil, which He has mentioned in His book. “From it (soil) We created you and to that soil We return you and take you out of that at another time.” (20:57) Seed is then mixed with that soil from which they are created later after settling in the womb for forty nights. When four months are complete they (agents) ask, “Lord, what do you want to create out of it?” He then commands them to do what He wants to be done as regards the gender of the fetus being white or black. When the spirit comes out from the body, the seed comes out from that person just as it was, regardless of being young or grown up, male or female. For this reason the dead body is washed (just as) it is washed for carnal activities. He said, ‘O child of the Messenger of Allah, I will never tell it to al-Qays al-Masir.’ He said, ‘It is up to you.’” ",

Certain ones have said that it is up to one’s chest and still others say that it is up to the whole height of a man, so one can pull the sheet over the head of those in the grave. The depth of Lahad is as high as one can sit straight inside. He (the narrator) has said that when Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, was about to die, he fainted for a while and then he removed the cloth and said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah who has made us heirs of paradise. We can live wherever we like and this is good reward for those who do good deeds.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Dig for me (a grave) and sprinkle water properly.’ He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then pulled the sheet over his face and passed away.’” (Shahid al-Thani has said that fainting of the Imam in this Hadith is not in a literal sense; as long as an Imam is alive he is responsible and in a fainting condition one is not responsible). (Lahad is a prepared room horizontally at the bottom of the grave as opposed to a vertical ditch in the center of the grave) ",

He (the Imam) said, ‘If there are three or two or ten or less or more, he performs one Salah (prayer) with five Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) just as it is done for one deceased, and in so doing one has performed Salah (prayer) for all of them. The body of one deceased man is placed on the ground, the other is placed parallel to the hips of the first one and the head of the third is placed parallel to the hips of the second one similar to a ladder, until all of them are in place. When this is done, he then stands up in the middle and says five Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) doing what is done for one deceased person.’ It then was asked, ‘How Salah (prayer) is performed if there are the dead bodies of both men and women. He (the Imam) said, ‘First, the bodies of men are arranged by placing the head of the second dead body parallel to the hips of the first one. When all the bodies of men are arranged in this way, then the head of the dead body of the first woman is placed parallel to the hips of the dead body of the last man, then the head of the other woman parallel to the hips of the first woman until all of them are arranged in this way. Then he stands in the middle, the middle of men, says Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) and performs Salah (prayer) for them just as performing Salah (prayer) for one deceased person.’ He (the Imam) was asked about the case of a dead body that was found after Salah (prayer) with his head in place of his leg. He (the Imam) said, ‘It is corrected and Salah (prayer) is performed again, even if the body is carried away but is not buried yet. Once the body is buried, time of Salah (prayer) is passed, and Salah (prayer) is not performed after burial.’” ",

One tradition is that on that day a sun eclipse took place and people said that it is because of the death of the son of the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah went on the pulpit, praised Allah and glorified Him; then said, “O people the sun and the moon are two signs of the signs of Allah which move because of His command and in obedience to Him. Their eclipse is not because of the death or life of anyone. If one or both of them eclipse perform Salah (prayer) for eclipse.” He climbed down the pulpit and performed Salah (prayer) because of eclipse with the people. When he completed his Salah (prayer) by saying the last phrase, the greeting, he (the Messenger of Allah) said, “O Ali, you must prepare my son for burial.” Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, gave Ghusl (bath) to Ibrahim, hunut and shroud. He brought the deceased out and the Messenger of Allah joined the funeral until they arrived near his grave. People said, “The Messenger of Allah has forgotten Salah (prayer) for Ibrahim due to shock because of his death.” He (the Messenger of Allah) stood up straight and said, “O people, Jibril just informed me of what you have thought about my forgetting Salah (prayer) for my son, Ibrahim, because of shock due to his death. You must know that it is not as you think it is. In fact the Most Kind and Most Aware one has made five Salah (prayer) obligatory on you and for your dead people. He has made five Takbir necessary, one Takbir from each Salah (prayer). He has commanded me to perform Salah (prayer) only for those who have performed Salah (prayer).” He (the Messenger of Allah) then said, “O Ali, climb down and place my son in al-Lahad.” He (Ali) climbed down and placed Ibrahim in Lahad. People said, “It is not proper for people to climb down in the grave of their sons because the Messenger of Allah has not done so.” The Messenger of Allah said to them, “O people, it is not unlawful for you to climb down in the grave of your sons, but I do not find it safe for you to do so because on opening the shroud of your sons Satan may play with you to cause a shock and you lose your reward.” He (the Messenger of Allah) thereafter, moved away and left the graveyard.’” ",

They say, ‘You say that there is no Salah (prayer) for those who have not performed any Salah (prayer).’ We say, ‘Yes that is true.’ They say, ‘Consider if a Christian or a Jew becomes a Muslim, then he dies within the same hour, then what is the answer?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Ask them to consider the case of this man, new Muslim, if he within the same hour falsely accuses a human being. What is his obligation because of his committing such sin? They will say that he is subject to punishment according to law. When they say this, then it is said to them, ‘If a child who has not performed any Salah (prayer) accuses a human being falsely, is he subjected to punishment according to law? They will say that he is not subject to any punishment. It then is said to them that you are right. Salah (prayer) is necessary for one who has performed Salah (prayer) and those who are subject to punishment according to law. Salah (prayer) is not necessary for one on whom Salah (prayer) is not obligatory or enduring punishment according to law.’” ",

He then turns to his property and says, “By Allah, I was very greedy and stingy about you. In what ways can you help me?” It will say, “All you can do is to take your shroud from me.” He then turns to his children saying, “I loved you, protected you all the time. In what ways can you help me?” They will say, “We can take you to your grave and bury you therein.” He then turns to his deeds and asks, “By Allah, I had very little inclination to perform you and felt burdened because of you. In what ways can you help me now?” His deed will say, “I am your companion in your grave up to the day you will be resurrected, until we both will be brought before your Lord.’” The Imam then said, ‘If he is a friend of Allah, a person, the best of people with fragrance, the best in beauty, and in the best of dresses comes to him and says, “I have brought you the happiness and fragrance of paradise of blessings and you are most welcome.” He will then ask, “Who are you?” The person says, “I am your good deeds. You now move from the worldly life to paradise.” He knows those who wash his body for burial and begs those who carry his coffin to hurry up. When he is placed in his grave, two angels will come with their hairs dragging on the ground and tearing the earth with their feet, with thunderous sounds and their eyes like swift lightening. They will ask, “Who is your Lord? What is your religion and who is your prophet?” He will reply, “Allah is my Lord, Islam is my religion and Muhammad, O Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, is my prophet.” The two angels will then say, “May Allah keep you steadfast in what you love and are happy therewith.” This is a reference to the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, “Allah keeps the believers steadfast in the unchanging words, in this world and in the next life” (14:26). The two angels then open up his grave as far as his eyes can see, and a door to paradise and then say to him, “Rest delightfully like a blessed young person,” because Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “People of paradise, on that day will have the best station and resting place” (25:26). The Imam then said, ‘If he is an enemy of his Lord, Allah’s ugliest creatures with the ugliest dress, appearance and smell will come to him and say, “Your place is boiling water and to suffer heat.” He knows people who wash his body for burial and begs those who carry his body to his grave to hold him back. When he is placed in his grave, the two examiners will come to him, remove his shroud away and ask him, “Who is your Lord? What is your religion and who is your prophet?” He will say, “I do not know.” They will say, “You did not know and you never had any guidance.” They will strike him at the front part of his head with a crashing hammer that they carry. The sound of this strike will frighten all creatures of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, except man and Jinn. They then open a door to hell for him and say to him, “Lie down here in worst condition, due to lack of space, as if squeezed like the iron spike into the tip of spears.” It will force his brain to squirt out of his toe and fingernails through the tissues of his flesh. Allah then gives his control to the snakes, scorpions and the creatures of earth that keep biting him until Allah will resurrect him from his grave. He will wish for the coming of the Day of Judgment because of suffering in his wicked condition.’” Jabir has said that abu Ja‘far has said that the Holy Prophet has said, ‘When watching the camels and sheep graze, before being commissioned as a prophet - there is no prophet who did not shepherd sheep - 1 could see them, while in safe and protected place and nothing around them, suddenly become excited and jump around frightened. I would say, “What is this strange phenomenon?” Once, Jibril (Gabriel) told me that when an unbeliever in his grave is struck on his head by the interrogating angels, all creatures of Allah, except man and Jinn, hear the sound of that (horrifying) strike and become frightened. I then said, “This is because of only one strike on the head of a disbeliever. I seek refuge with Allah against the (rest of the) torments in the grave.’”” ",

How few are those who remain safe from the pressure in the grave! When Ruqiyyah was murdered..., the Messenger of Allah stood on her grave and raised his head toward the sky, his eyes flooded with tears, and said to people, “I thought of her and her condition in the grave moved me to a weeping state. I pleaded before Allah to give her safety from the pressure of the grave as a gift for me.’” He (the Imam) has said that the Messenger of Allah then said, “O Lord, save Ruqiyyah from the pressure of the grave as gift to me.” Allah then granted him that gift. The Messenger of Allah took part in the funeral of Sa‘d in which seventy thousand angels had also taken part. The Messenger of Allah raised his head to the sky and said, ‘Even (a person like) Sa‘d undergoes the pressure of the grave.’ I then said to the Imam, ‘It is said that he (Sa‘d) would not pay much attention to the uncleanness from his urine.’ He replied, ‘May Allah grant protection, it was due to his harsh manners toward his family (wife).’ The Imam then said that mother of Sa‘d said, ‘How fortunate are you, O Sa‘d!’ the Messenger of Allah then said, ‘O mother of Sa‘d, please do not consider it (granting an opportune) an obligation upon Allah.’” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad as well as Sahl ibn Ziyad and Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father, all from ibn Mahbub from Ali ibn Ri’ab from Durays al-Kunasiy who has said the following: “I said to abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, ‘People say that our Euphrates gushes forth from the Garden (paradise). How can that be the case? It flows from the west and many springs and waters of valleys fall into it.’ The narrator has that abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said while I was listening, ‘Allah has a garden. Allah has created it in the west. The waters of your Euphrates come from there and to this (garden) the souls (spirits) of believing people travel from their graves every evening. They descend upon its fruits, eat thereof, enjoy, meet others and get to know them. At dawn they move from the garden and remain in the air between earth and the sky, fly back and forth; at sunrise they visit their graves, meet in the air and get to know each other.’ The Imam then said, ‘Allah has a fire in the east. He has created it for the souls (spirits) of the unbelievers. They eat from Zaqqum (the fruit of the infernal tree) and drink from its boiling water all night; at dawn they move to a valley in Yemen called ‘Barahut’, which is hotter than the fire of the world, where they meet and get to know each other. In the evening they return to the fire. They remain in this condition until the Day of Judgment.’ The narrator has said that I then asked, ‘May Allah keep you well, in what condition do the people remain who believe in one Creator, and who seek nearness (to Allah) through the prophet-hood of Muhammad, O Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause? They are of the Muslims who have sinned and they die. They have no Imam and do not acknowledge your Divine Authority.’ He said, ‘They remain in their pit (graves) and do not come out from there. For those of them who have done good deeds and who have not expressed animosity (toward us), a line is drawn for them to the garden, which Allah has created in the west. Through this the garden happiness comes to their grave until the Day of Judgment when they come before Allah. He then shows them the account of their good and bad deeds and thereafter they are sent to paradise or to the fire. Their case depends on Allah’s Judgment.’ The Imam then said, ‘In the same way He deals with the feeble-minded, the dimwitted ones, children and the children of Muslims who die before maturity. However, for those of the people of Qiblah (people who face Ka’bah during their prayers) who express animosity (toward Ahl al-Bayt) a line is drawn to the fire, which Allah has created in the east, wherefrom heat and flame and smoke and jets of hot water reach them until the Day of Judgment. Thereafter their destination will be to hot water, then to the fire, which will attack them. Then it will be said to them, “To whom, other than Allah, would you invite people? Where is your Imam whom you had chosen other than the Imam whom Allah had made for people?””’ ",

He (the Imam) said, ‘During one day and night five Salah (prayer) are made obligatory.’ I then asked, ‘Has He named and explained them in His book?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, Allah, most High has said to His Holy Prophet, “Perform Salah (prayer) after the sun declines to the west, on midday until the darkness of the night.” (17: 78). The sun declines on midday. There are four Salah (prayer) between midday and the darkness of the night. Allah has named, explained and timed them. Darkness of night is in midnight. He, most Blessed, most High has then said, “. . . and the recitation (performing Salah (prayer)) at dawn and recitation at dawn was witnessed (attended by the angels of the day and those of the nights).” These are five Salah (prayers). Allah, most High about this issue has said, “Perform Salah (prayer) on both ends of the day, [which is sunset and morning], and in a part of the night.” (11:116) This is al-Tsha’ Salah (prayer) He, most High has said, “Preserve Salah (prayer) especially the middle Salah (prayer).” (2:239) Middle Salah (prayer) is al- Dhuhr Salah (prayer) which is the first Salah (prayer) the Messenger of Allah performed. It is in the middle of two Salah (prayer) during the day, the morning and al-‘Asr Salah (prayer). In some of the recitations it is said, “Preserve Salawat (prayers) and the middle Salah (prayer).” Middle Salah (prayer) is al-‘Asr Salah (prayer).’ About the words of Allah, “Stand up praying before Allah,” he (the Imam) said, ‘This verse was revealed on Friday when the Messenger of Allah was on a journey. The Messenger of Allah prayed before Allah on Friday and left it in that condition during a journey or when at home. For those at home he added two Rak‘ats. He reduced two Rak‘at which the Holy Prophet, had added on Friday for people when at home, because of the two sermons which a prayer leader delivers.

When is it and how is it? At certain times is half of one step.’ He (the Imam) said that in the Hadith is it said, ‘ An object’s shadow’ and not the shadow of an object’ is because the shadow of an object may appear in different sizes, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, but an object is an object all the time and it does not change. Hadith has said that it is one yard or two yards, one step or two steps.” Thus one yard or two yards have become explanation of one length or two lengths during the time when an object’s shadow is of the size of one yard and two object’s shadows of the size of two yards. Therefore one object’s or two objects’ shadows and one yard or two yards are in agreement with each other in times as understood one, explaining the other and supported thereby. At a given time, for example at one O’clock, when an object’s shadow is of the size of one yard the time (for Salah (prayer)) is one yard of an object’s shadow and the object is a yard of the shadow. When an object’s shadow is less or more, the time is measured in yards or two yards. This is the explanation of one length and a yard or two yards.’” (The theme of Hadith is obvious; it only may need a little thinking to grasp it fully.) ",

I will follow your instructions. 5 He (the Imam) wrote back with his own handwriting and I read it: “Dawn, Allah has granted you kindness, is when the white line appears sideways; and it is not vertical, during which time you do not perform Salah (prayer) on a journey or when at home until it is obvious. Allah, most Blessed, most High, does not leave His creatures in confusion in this matter so He has said, ‘Eat and drink until a white line appears from a darkness line at dawn. 5 (2:187) The white line is that which is sideways and after the appearance of which eating and drinking become unlawful because of fasting, and so also Salah (prayer) becomes obligatory at such time.’” ",

Say Adhan and ’Iqamah, then perform it, thereafter perform what is after this with just ‘Iqamah for every Salah (prayer).’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘If you have already performed al-Dhuhr, then remembered that you have missed the morning Salah (prayer), perform the morning Salah (prayer) in whatever hour you remember even if it is after al-‘Asr. Whenever you remember a Salah (prayer) that you have missed, perform it.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘If you forget to perform al-Dhuhr until you perform al-‘Asr, then remember in the middle of Salah (prayer) or after you complete a Salah (prayer) consider it the first one (al-Dhuhr which is missed).

You should not stand for Salah (prayer) in a lazy mode, slumbering or feeling burdened; each one of such things is of behaviors of hypocrites. Allah, the Most Glorious, has forbidden the believers to stand up for prayer in a lazy mode, that is, feeling sleepy. He has said about the hypocrites, “When they stand up for Salah (prayer) they do so in a lazy mode and just to show off to people and they do not speak of (remember) Allah but very little” (4:141).’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, one day asked me, ‘Do you know how to perform Salah (prayer) properly?’ I said, ‘I keep the book of Hariz with me in Salah (prayer).’ The Imam said, ‘Nevermind, O Hammad. Stand up and perform Salah (prayer).’ The narrator has said, ‘I then stood up in his presence, facing the direction of Qiblah (Makkah). I began performing Salah (prayer), with Ruku‘ and Sajdah.’ He then said, “O Hammad, you do not know how to perform Salah (prayer) properly. It is a shame for a man of your people who at the age of sixty or seventy cannot even perform one Salah (prayer) according to its complete rules and manners.’ Hammad has said, ‘I belittled myself very much at this point. I then asked him saying, “I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause teach me how to perform Salah (prayer) properly.’” Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, stood up straight facing the direction of Qiblah. He allowed his hands to rest on his thighs, with his fingers close side by side, kept his feet near each other, only leaving between them a distance of three fingers opened up, with his toes facing the direction of Qiblah without allowing them to deviate from this direction and with humbleness said, ‘Allah is great.’ He then recited al-Hamd (the first Chapter of the Holy Quran) with clarity and fluency and Chapter 112 of the Holy Quran. He then paused for a breath while still standing and raised his hands up to the sides of his face and said, ‘Allah is great,’ while still standing. He then bent down for Ruku‘ (kneeling). He then placed his palms over his knees allowing them to be filled up with his knees that were separate from each other, and pressed them backward until his back became so straightly level that even if there had been a drop of water or oil it would not flow to any side. He stretched his neck forward, lowered his eyes and then said with clarity and fluency three times, ‘I praise my Lord, the Great, Who is free of all defects.’ He then stood up straight. While standing straight he said, ‘Allah hears all those who praise Him.’ He then while standing raised his hands up to the sides of his face and said, ‘Allah is great.’ Then he bowed down for sajdah. He opened his palms with his fingers close side by side, placed them near his knees on the sides next to his face and said, ‘I praise my Lord, the most High who is free of all defects,’ three times. He did not place any other part of his body on any other part thereof. He performed sajdah on eight parts of his bones: his palms, knees, big toes of his feet, his forehead and his nose. He (the Imam) said, ‘Placing seven parts of these bones on the ground is obligatory during sajdah but one of them (the nose) is not obligatory. This is what Allah has spoken of in the Quran, “The parts of the body to be placed on the ground during sajdah belong to Allah, you then must not worship anyone other than Allah.” (72:17) Such parts are forehead, palms, knees and big toes of feet. Placing one’s nose on the ground is optional.’ He then raised his head from sajdah. When he sat up straight, he then said, ‘Allah is great.’ He then sat on his left thigh placing the back of his right foot over the sole of his left foot and then said, ‘I seek forgiveness from Allah, my Lord and turn to Him in repentance.’ He then said, ‘Allah is great.’ Then he bowed down for second sajdah, saying therein what he said in the first sajdah. He did not place any other part of his body on any other part during Ruku‘ or sajdah. He spread his elbows and did not place his arms on the ground. In this way, he performed two Rak‘ats of Salah (prayer). He (the Imam) kept the fingers of his hands close side by side when saying the two testimonies in a sitting position. When he finished saying the testimonies, he then read Sal am and said, ‘O Hammad, you must perform Salah (prayer) like this.’” (Ahadith 2-7 are best explained by fatwa.) ",

In the last Sajdah (prostration) of the first two Rak‘at say, “O the Most High, O the Most Great, O the Beneficent, O the Merciful, O the Hearer of the pleas for help. You are the conferrer of the good, grant al-Salah (favors) upon Muhammad and his family. Facilitate for me of the good things of this and of the good things of the next world that much which You deem proper. Divert away from me the evil of this and the next world that much that You deem proper and relieve me from this pain;’ - mention it by its name - ‘it has caused me anguish and sadness,’ and be persistent in your pleading and prayer.’” The narrator has said that before his reaching al-Kufa Allah had totally relieved him from that illness.’” ",

My submissive face has prostrated before Your majestic face. My poor face has prostrated before the self-sufficient, gracious, most High and great face of my Lord. My Lord, I beg You to forgive me for what has happened and what will happen. My Lord, do not allow my afflictions to intensify. Do not allow my enemy to rejoice at my misfortunes. My Lord, do not make my destiny to end up in a bad form. O Lord, there is no one except You to defend me against or prevent evil matters to afflict me. O Allah, grant Muhammad and his family compensation worthy of their serving Your cause, grant them the best form of compensation, grant them the best of Your blessings. O Lord, I seek Your protection against Your strength. O Lord, I seek Your protection against all forms of Your anger and displeasure. You are free of all defects. No one deserves to be worshipped except You, Cherisher of the worlds.”’  He (the Imam) said that ’Amir al-Mu’minin Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, would say the following in prostrating position: ‘O Lord, grant mercy to my submissive condition before You and my pleading to You, and to my feeling afraid among people and comfortable with You, O gracious One.’ He would also say, ‘O Lord, You gave me good advice but I failed to learn a lesson. You warned me about committing what You have prohibited but I failed to observe Your prohibitions. You granted me bounties as long as I have lived but I failed to give You thanks. O Lord, I beg You to forgive me, O Lord, I beg You to forgive me, O gracious One, I beg You to grant me comfort at the time of dying. I beg You to forgive me at the time of issuing judgment.’” “Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, in prostration condition would say the following: ‘No one deserves worship except You. You deserve worship in all truth and without doubts. I have prostrated before You, my Lord as (Your) slave and a sole servant. O Most great, my (good) deeds are weak, so please increase them for me, O gracious Lord. O compassionate Lord, forgive my sins and crimes and accept my deeds, O gracious Lord. O most powerful Lord, I seek protection with You against failure or tolerating injustice. O Lord, from You come bounties and You grant the ability to appreciate such bounties. With You are the reward due to your generosity and benevolence and Your graciously caring.’” ",

Ali has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa and Muhammad ibn Isma’il from al-Fadl ibn Shadhan from Hammad ibn ‘Isa and Muhammad ibn Yahya from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Hariz from Zurarah who has said the following: “Abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘When you stand up for Salah (prayer) do not allow one foot to touch the other, leave between them a distance of one finger at the least and one Shibr (about 8 inches) at most. Allow your shoulders to relax and leave your hands alone. Do not crisscross your fingers. Instead they should be kept on your thighs on its front side and your eyes should look at the place for prostration. During Ruku‘ position line up your feet with a distance of one shibr in between them, allow your fingers to hold on to your knees. Place your right palm on your right knee before placing the left palm on your left knee. Allow your fingers to reach to the sides of your knees and stretch your fingers when placed on your knees. If during Ruku‘ the tips of your fingers reach your knees it is sufficient but I like that your palm should rest on your knees so you can allow your finger to hold to your knees while they (knees) are kept apart. Your back should be straight, your neck stretched forward and your looks should be kept between your feet. “When you are ready for prostration, raise your hands for saying “Allah is great”, then bow down for prostration. First your hands should be placed on the ground, before your knees, together but do not place your forearms on the ground as beasts do. You must not place your forearms on your knees or thighs but open them up as wings with your elbows. You must not touch your knees with your palms and do not place them very close to your face. Place them in between level with your shoulders. You must not place them in front of your knees. Place them a little out, extend them on the ground and keep them a little toward you. If there is some cloth underneath, it does not matter, and if you allow them to be placed on the ground it is better. You must not keep your fingers apart from each other during your sajdah but keep them close side by side.’ The Imam said, ‘When you sit up straight for reading the testimonies, keep your knees touching the ground and a little apart from each other. The back of your left foot should be on the ground, the back of you right foot should be placed on the bottom of your left foot and both hips should be placed on the ground as well as the tip of the big toe of your right foot. You should never sit on both your feet; it may hurt you. You should not sit on the ground; in this way some parts of you are sitting on the others and you cannot bear sitting this way for reading the testimonies and supplications.’” ",

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Faddal from ibn Bukayr from ‘Ubayd Allah al-Halabiy who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about mistakes which befall on me a great deal. He (the Imam) said, ‘Incorporate your Salah (prayer) properly.’ I then asked, ‘What is incorporating?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is saying three Tasbih (Allah is free of all defects) in Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees) and in Sujud (prostrations).’ “It is narrated that if one makes mistakes in optional Salah (prayer) he considers it to be of the lesser side.” (The following to the next chapter seems to be like fatwa of al-Kulayni (rh) that he has summarized) “All the cases of mistakes are seventeen in number. In seven of them it is necessary to perform Salah (prayer) again. (1) One case is when one forgets the opening Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) which one does not remember until Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees) (2) The second case is when one forgets Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees) and Sujud (prostrations). (3) The third case is when one forgets and does not know if he has performed one or two Rak‘at. (4) The fourth case is when one forgets something in al-Maghrib and in the morning Salah (prayer). (5) It is when one increases something in his Salah (prayer). (6) It is when one does not know if he has increased or decreased and his guess does not settle anywhere. (7) It is when one moves away from Salah (prayer) before completing. “There are those conditions in which performing Salah (prayer) again is not necessary. Only two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake is necessary. Of such cases is: (1) when one says Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) in two Rak‘at then speaks before moving away his face from al- Qiblah (al-Ka‘bah). He completes his Salah (prayer), then performs two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake. (2) One who forgets Tashahhud (testimonies of belief) and does not sit down in two Rak‘at and it is missed until Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees) in the third Rak‘at. He performs two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake and makes up for Tashahhud (testimonies of belief) which is missed. (3) One who does not know if he has performed four or five, has to perform two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake. (4) One who by mistake speaks in his Salah (prayer) improperly, like commanding or prohibiting because of forgetfulness and not in a willful manner. He performs two Sajdah (prostration). Sajdah (prostration) is necessary in these four cases. Of such cases are where performing Salah (prayer) again is not necessary as well as Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake. (1) One is he who corrects his mistake before it is late like one who is to stand up but instead sits down or is to sit down but stands up then remembers it before entering in another condition, in such case he is to perform Qada 5 (perform a compensatory) for it. (2) Another is he who says Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) in the first two Rak‘at then remembers. He completes before he speaks in which case the rules for mistake is not applicable to his case. (3) The rule for mistake does apply to the case of one behind an Imam who remembers and (4) as well as to the case of an Imam if people behind him remember. (5) The rule for mistake does not apply to mistake in a mistake. (6) The rule for does not apply to a mistake in optional Salah (prayer) and the rule for mistake does not apply to a repeat in optional Salah (prayer). These are six cases where repeat is not necessary as well as two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake. “One who doubts about the opening Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) and does not know if he has said it or not, he is to say it when he remembers before Ruku‘, then does the recitation then Rukuk If one doubts in Ruku‘ and does not know if he has said the opening Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) or not, he continues his Salah (prayer) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If he becomes certain of not saying the opening Takbir (Allah is great beyond description), he performs his Salah (prayer) again. If one doubts when he is standing and he does not know if he has performed Ruku‘ or not, he performs Ruku‘ to ascertain his performing Rukuk If one performs Ruku‘, then remembers that he has already performed Ruku‘, he sends himself down to Sajdah (prostration) without raising his head from Ruku‘ in Rukuk If he continues and raises his head from Ruku‘, then remembers that he has already performed Ruku‘, he performs his Salah (prayer) again; he has increased in his Salah (prayer) one Rak’at. One who performs Sajdah (prostration) and because of doubt does not know if one has performed Ruku‘ or not, one continues his Salah (prayer) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter, because of his doubt unless one becomes certain that one has not performed Rukuk In this case one performs his Salah (prayer) again. If one performs Sajdah (prostration) and does not know if one has performed one or two Sajdah (prostration), one is to perform another Sajdah (prostration) to ascertain performing two Sajdah (prostration). If one performs Sajdah (prostration) and remembers that he has already performed two Sajdah (prostration), one is to perform his Salah (prayer) again, because of increase in his Salah (prayer) one Sajdah (prostration). If one doubts after standing and does not know if one has performed one or two Sajdah (prostration) one is to continue his Salah (prayer) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one is certain that one has performed only one Sajdah (prostration), one is to perform another Sajdah (prostration) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one reads Surah (chapter) then remembers that one has performed only one Sajdah (prostration), one is to perform another Sajdah (prostration), then stand up to complete the recitation and perform Ruku‘ and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one performs Ruku‘ and becomes certain that one has not performed any Sajdah (prostration) but only one Sajdah (prostration) or has not performed any Sajdah (prostration) at all, one is to perform Salah (prayer) again.” Mistakes in Tashahhud (testimonies of belief):“If one by mistake stands up before Tashahhud (testimonies of belief) in two Rak’ah, he is to sit down and say Tashahhud, if he has not reached in Ruku’ (bowing down on one’s knees), then stand up and continues his Salah (prayer) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one has assumed Ruku’ and learns that one has not said Tashahhud, continues one’s Salah (prayer) and when one ends his Salah (prayer) performs two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake and he is not obligated for anything in the condition of doubt as long one is not certain.” Mistakes about Two or Four Rak’ah:“One who doubts and does not know if one has performed two or four Rak’at, if one’s guess settles on four, one says Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess settles on one’s performing two Rak’ah, one performs two more Rak’ah and he is not obligated for anything in this matter if one’s guess is equal, one says Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace), then performs two Rak’ah in a standing position with al-Fatihah al-Kitab. If, in fact, one has performed two Rak’ah these two Rak’ah complete the four and if, in fact, one has performed four Rak’ah these two become optional Salah (prayer). Mistake about Two or Three Rak’ah “One who doubts and does not know if one has performed two or three Rak’ah and his guess settles on the side of two Rak’ah, one is to perform two more Rak’ah and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess settles on the side of three, one then is to perform one more Rak’ah and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess does not settle on either side and one is certain of performing two Rak’ah, one is to perform one Rak’ah in a standing position, then say Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) and performs two Rak’ah in a sitting position with al-Fatihah al- Kitab. If one, in fact, has performed two Rak’ah, the two Rak’ah performed in a standing position before Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) complete the four Rak’ah. The two Rak’ah in a sitting position are in place of one Rak’ah and his Salah (prayer) is complete. If one has performed three Rak’ah the one Rak’ah performed in a standing position completes the four Rak’ah and the two Rak’ah one has performed in a sitting position are counted as optional Salah (prayer). Mistakes about Four or Three Rak’ah “One who doubts and does not know if one has performed three or four and his guess settles on the side of three Rak’ah, one is to perform one Rak’ah, then say Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess settles on the side of four, one says Salam and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess settles on three and four, one says Salam with his doubtful condition and performs two Rak’ah in a sitting position with al- Fatihah al-Kitab. If one has performed three the two Rak’ah are counted as one to complete the four, and if one has performed four Rak’ah these two are counted as optional Salah (prayer) in one’s favor. Mistakes about Four or Five Rak’ah “One who doubts and does not know if one has performed four or five Rak’ah, if one’s guess settles on the side of four, one is to say Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) and he is not obligated for anything in this matter. If one’s guess settles on five one performs his Salah (prayer) again. If one’s guess about both sides are equal one is to say Salam, then perform two Sajdah (prostration) because of mistake which are destroyers (of Satan). ",

I only said to him that when performing Salah (prayer) if one is attentive toward it, does not speak to one’s soul in it and does not make mistakes in it, Allah comes forward eagerly to what is performed eagerly. Perhaps one half is raised, one fourth, one third or one fifth is raised. We command to perform Sunnah only to complete what is missed of obligatory ones.’” ",

He (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, wrote to me, ‘Find other clothes for your Salah (prayer).’ I then wrote to abu Ja’far, the second, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, saying, ‘I would write to your father, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about such and such issues. It became difficult for me and I then began to make them from leather of wild donkeys, properly slaughtered.’ He (the Imam) wrote to me, ‘All good deeds require patience, I pray to Allah to grant you blessings. If what you do is from wild ones and properly slaughtered, then it is not harmful.’” ",

We praise Him, beg assistance from Him, ask Him for forgiveness, seek guidance from Him and seek protection with Him against the evil of our own selves and our own bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, no one can mislead and whomever Allah causes to go astray, no one is able to guide.’ “I testify that no one, other than Allah, deserves worship. He (Allah) is one, He has no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. He chose him to serve as one with His Authority, made him a special person with His message and honored him with prophesy. He (Muhammad) is the trustee with Allah’s unseen matters and is a mercy for all the worlds. O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. Servants of Allah, I advise you to observe piety before Allah and warn you of His punishment. Allah saves those who observe piety before Him to enjoy happiness. Thus, bad things cannot touch them and they do not feel sadness. Allah honors those who fear Him, protects against things from which they were afraid and allows them to experience affluence and joy. I encourage you to be interested in the grace of Allah, which is forever, I warn you of His punishment, which never ends, and there is no relief thereby for those who are subject to it. Thus, you must not allow worldly matters to deceive you and you should not rely on them; it is a dwelling of deception. Allah has deemed it and its dwellers to face destruction. Thus you must supply yourselves by the things with which Allah has honored you, in the form of observing piety and virtuous deeds; the good deeds of the servant of Allah do not receives acceptance before Allah unless they are pure and Allah does not accept (good deeds) from anyone other than the pious ones. Allah has informed you of the positions of those who believe in Him, do good deeds, and of the positions of the unbelievers of improper deeds saying, “That is the Day (of resurrection) where all people are gathered and that is the day of the presence of everyone. We delay it only for an appointed time. The day it comes not a single soul can speak without His permission. Thus, certain ones of the people are unfortunate and others are fortunate ones. The unfortunate ones are in the fire wherein they wail and cry. Therein they live forever as long as the skies and earth are there, except if your Lord wishes otherwise. Your Lord certainly, does whatever He wants. Those who are fortunate, they are in paradise wherein they live forever as long as the skies and earth are there, unless your Lord wishes otherwise, such as granting unending gifts.” (11:102-108). We pray to Allah who has brought us in this gathering to make our day a blessing and grant mercy to all of us; He has power over all things. The Book of Allah is the most truthful narration and has the best stories. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “When Quran is recited, listen to it and remain silent so that perhaps you receive mercy.” (7:203) Thereafter recite a chapter from the Holy Quran and pray to your Lord and say, “Allahumma Salli ’Ala Muhammad wa ’Ali Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause).” Pray for the believing people, male and female. Then sit down for a short while and then say: “All praise belongs to Allah. We praise Him, beg assistance from Him, and beg of Him to forgive us, seek guidance from Him, believe in Him, trust Him and seek protection with Him against the evil of our own selves and our own bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, no one can mislead and whomever Allah causes to go astray no one is able to guide.” “I testify that no one, other than Allah, deserves worship. He (Allah) is one, He has no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. He sent him with guidance and true religion to make His religion stand supreme over all religions even though the pagans dislike, and He has made him to be a mercy for all the worlds, with glad news and warning that calls people to Allah by His permission and is a shining beacon. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, finds the right guidance and whoever disobeys becomes lost.’ “Servants of Allah I advise you to observe piety before Allah. Those who obey Allah benefit thereby and those who disobey Him suffer losses. Allah is the One in whose presence you will all return. He is the One who will judge you (for your merits). Observing piety is Allah’s advice for you and for those who lived before you. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “We advised those to whom heavenly book was given before you as well as yourselves to be pious before Allah but if you disbelieve all things in heavens and on earth belongs to Allah, Allah is self-sufficient and praiseworthy.” (4:130). “You must benefit from Allah’s advice and hold fast to His book; it has most eloquent pieces of advice and the best of things in matters of consequences. Allah has established His arguments against people. He gives them the chance not to face destruction without enough opportunity to follow proper guidance, so if they face their own destruction they face it without any excuse and those who follow guidance and live can do so with valid proofs. The Messenger of Allah has already preached the message that he brought (from Allah). You must strictly follow his will and the matters that he has left among you, in the form of two heavy issues, the book of Allah and his family. Whoever follows them (the two issues) will never go astray and those who abandon them (the two issues) will never find any guidance.’ “Allahumma Salli ‘Ala Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad, Your servant and messenger, the master of the messengers, the leader of the pious people, the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause.” Then say, “O Allah grant Ali, Amir al- Mu’minin, the executor of the will of the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, a compensation worthy of his serving Your cause.” Then mention all ’A’immah one by one up to the twelfth Imam, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, and then say, “O Allah, please, grant him easy victory and support him with a mighty support. O Lord, make through him Your religion to stand supreme as well as the Sunnah (traditions) of Your prophet, so that nothing of the truth remains hidden for fear of any creature. O Lord, we wish to live under a graceful government in which You grant might to Islam and its followers, humiliate hypocrisy and hypocrite people. In such government, make us to be the preacher to following your laws and leaders to your path. Under such government, grant us the grace of this life as well as the life to come. O Lord, make us to know fully the truth that You have made us to bear and teach us to correct our shortcomings.” “He then should pray to Allah to condemn His enemies and pray for himself and his friends. They then should raise their hands and pray to Allah for all of their wishes until it is complete and then say, “O Lord, answer our prayers.” At the end he should say, “Allah commands to practice justice and do good and to yield to the rights of relatives, and prohibits committing indecency, unlawful matters and to rebel against the truth. I give you good advice so you can be considerate.” Then say, “O Lord, make us to be of those who are reminded and such reminders have benefited them.” Then end the sermon.’” ",

My father came back and sat down and said, “I was in the court of this (governor) a little while ago and people asked about Taqsir (reducing Salah (prayer) on a journey after traveling a certain distance).

He (the Governor) then asked me and I said, ‘When Jibril came with Taqsir (reducing Salah (prayer) on a journey after traveling a certain distance) to the Messenger of Allah, the Holy prophet asked him, “At what distance is this?” He (Jibril) said, “It is at one barid.” He (the Messenger of Allah) asked, “What is that?” Jibril replied, “It is between the shadow of ‘Ayr (a certain mountain) to the shadow of 0‘Ayr.”’ He (the Imam) said that time passed, then it was seen that banu ‘Umayyah had placed marks on the road and mentioned what Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, had spoken of. They placed signs on the shadow of ‘Ayr and the outline of 0‘Ayr. They then divided it into twelve miles and it was three thousand and five hundred yards for each mile. They had placed signs on them. When banu Hashim appeared they changed the affairs of banu ‘Umayyah in a certain way because Hadith is from banu Hashim, thus they placed a sign next to each sign.’” (the Arabic word for yard is Dhira‘ (from the elbow to the tip of the fingers which is about eighteen inches)).

He is most holy. He is the Lord of angels and the spirit. His mercy comes before His anger. No one, other than You (Allah), deserves worship. You do not have any partner. I have done bad deeds and have done injustice to my own soul, so forgive and grant me mercy; no one, other than You, is able to forgive sins.” When you get up look to the sky and say, “O Lord, the dark night cannot curtain You, nor the sky with its constellations, or the vast expanse of earth, or the darkness one over the other, or the ocean with its giant waves that curtain Your creatures from each other. You know whatever eyes steal or the chests hide. The stars have disappeared, eyes have gone to sleep, You are the living guardian whom sleep and slumber cannot overtake. Free from all defect is the Cherisher of the worlds, Lord of the messengers and all praise belongs to Allah, The Cherisher of the worlds.” Then read five verses from Chapter Three: “The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the night are evidence (of the existence of Allah) for people of reason (3:190). It is these who commemorate Allah while standing, sitting, or resting on their sides and who think about the creation of the heavens and the earth and say, ‘Lord, you have not created all this without reason. Glory be to You. Lord, save us from the torment of the fire.’ (3:191). Our Lord, those whom You consign to the fire are certainly disgraced. There is no helper for the unjust. (3:192) “Lord, we have heard the person calling to the faith and have accepted his call. Forgive our sins, expiate our bad deeds, and allow us to die with the righteous ones. (3:193) Lord, grant us the victory that You have promised Your Messenger and do not disgrace us on the Day of Judgment; You are the One who never ignores His promise.” (3:194) “Thereafter brush your teeth; and make Wudu’. When placing your hand in water say, “(I begin) by the name of Allah, and with the power of Allah. O Lord, make me of the repenting ones and of those who purify themselves.” When you complete Wudu’ say, “All praise belongs to Allah, Cherisher of the worlds.” When you stand up for Salah (prayer) say, “(I begin) in the name of Allah, with (the power of) Allah, to Allah, from Allah and with the will of Allah and there is no means or power except the power and means of Allah. O Lord, make me of the visitors of Your house and of the builders of Masjids, please open for me the door to repent before You and close to me the door of disobedience to You and all sins. All praise belongs to Allah who has made me of those who speak to Him. O Lord, turn to me with Your face, the majestic in praise.” Then begin your Salah (prayer) with the first Takbir.’” (Ahadith 2-12 can best be explained by fatwa.) ",

What is he required to do?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He performs so many that cannot say how many is performed.

If his business is for the worldly matters which keeps him away from his Salah (prayer), then it is necessary for him to perform the Qada’ (compensatory prayer), otherwise, he will meet Allah as one considered neglectful, humiliated and destroying the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah.’ I then said, ‘He is not able to perform the Qada’ (compensatory prayer).

He performs, with people, two Rak‘at without Adhan and ‘Iqamah, then he climbs on the pulpit with his gown turned upside down by wearing its right shoulder (sleeve) on his left shoulder (arm) and its left sleeve on his right shoulder.

I hope they will not be deprived.’ He (the narrator) has said that he followed the instruction and when we returned rain came and they said, ‘It is of the instruction of Ja‘far (‘ Alayhi al-Salam).’” “In the narration of Yunus it is said, ‘We had not returned yet that rain came.’” (Hadith 1 is best explained by fatwa.)

How many Rak‘at has it and how we perform it? He (the Imam) said, ‘It has ten Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees) and four Sajadat (prostrations).

If you finish before it (sun or moon) is cleared, sit down and pray before Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, until it is cleared. If it clears before you finish Salah (prayer), complete the remaining. Make the recitation loud.’ I then asked, ‘How is recitation in this Salah (prayer)?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If you recite Surah (a chapter) in every Rak‘at, recite al-Fatihah al-Kitab, but if you reduce from Surah (chapter) something, then recite from where you left and do not recite al-Fatihah al-Kitab.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is desirable to recite al-Kahf (Chapter 18) and al-Hijr (Chapter 15), unless one is the Imam and is afraid of causing difficulties for people behind him. Your Salah (prayer) should be in the open, without being covered by a house, if you can do so.

People remained anticipating. The Messenger of Allah said, ‘I give you something and if you practice every day, it will be better for you than the whole world and all that it contains. If you practice it every two days, Allah forgives you during the time in between. For your practicing it every Friday or every month or every year, Allah grants you forgiveness during the time in between. Perform four Rak‘at Salah (prayer). Begin the Salah (prayer), complete the recitations and then say, “Allah is free of all defects, all praise belongs to Allah, no one, other than Allah, deserves worship and Allah is great” fifteen times. In Ruku‘ position, say it ten times. After Ruku‘ (bowing down on one’s knees)’, when standing, say it ten times. In the first sajdah say it ten times. When sitting between the two sajdah say it ten times. In the second sajdah say it ten times. After the second sajdah before standing up for the second Rak‘at say it ten times. This amounts to seventy-five Tasbihah, which makes it three hundred Tasbihah in one Rak‘at and in four Rak‘at Salah (prayer) it becomes one thousand two hundred Tasbihah, Tahlilah, Tahmidah and Takbirah. You may perform this Salah (prayer) during the day or night as you wish.’ “It is in a Hadith (narration) from Ibrahim ibn ‘Abd al-Hamid that abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said the following. ‘In the first Rak‘at after the first Chapter of the Holy Quran recite Chapter 99. In the second Rak‘at you should recite Chapter 100, in the third Rak‘at recite Chapter 110 and in the fourth Rak‘at read Chapter 112 of the Holy Quran.’ I then asked, ‘What is the reward for this Salah (prayer)?’ The Imam replied, ‘If his sins are as many as grains of sand in a pile, Allah forgives him.’ He then looked at me and said, ‘This is for you and your people only.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from ibn ’Udhaynah who has said the following: “Abu ’Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, asked me, ‘What does the enemy narrate?’ I then asked, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, what kind of narration do you mean?’ He said, ‘It is about their Adhan, Ruku‘, and sajdah?’ I then said, ‘They say, “Ubay ibn Ka‘b has seen them in a dream.’” The Imam said, ‘They have spoken a lie. The religion of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, is by far more exalted than being seen in a dream.’ The narrator has said that Sadir al- Sayrafiy then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, please enlighten us about it.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘When Allah, the most Majestic, the most Glorious, took His prophet for a journey to His seven heavens, in the first heaven He granted him blessing and in the second one He taught him his obligations. Allah sent down a carriage that was made of light with forty kinds of the kinds of light therein, surrounded by the Throne of Allah that covers the eyesight of the on-lookers. One of those lights is yellow from which yellowness is yellow. Another one is red because of which redness is red, yet another one is white because of which whiteness is white. The rest of them are like the number of the creatures in the form of light and colors. In that carriage, there are rings and chains of silver. Thereafter He took him up in the heaven. The angels moved in all directions of the heaven and fell down in prostration saying, “He is free of all defects and Most Holy. How similar is this light to the light of our Lord!”’ Jibril (Gabriel) then said, ‘Allah is greater than can be described, Allah is greater than can be described.’ Then the doors of the heaven opened, the angels gathered and saluted to the Holy Prophet in large groups saying, “O Muhammad, how is your brother? When you go back to earth tell that we salute him.” The Holy Prophet asked them, “Do you know him?” They replied, “How can we forget him. We were made (by Allah) to establish a covenant and commitment to (follow and) support him; support you and his followers until the Day of Judgment. We look on the faces of his followers five times every day - meaning thereby during the five times Salah (prayer). We say, ‘Allahumma Salli ‘Ala Muhammad wa ‘Ali Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause).”’ The Messenger of Allah thereafter has said, “Then my Lord granted me forty kinds of kinds of light of which no one resembled the ones given to me before. He gave me more rings and chains and took me to the second heaven. When I arrived near the second heaven’s door, the angels moved to all directions of the heaven and fell down in prostration saying, ‘Free of all defects and Most Holy is the Lord of the angels and the spirit. How similar is this light to the light of our Lord!’ Jibril then said, ‘I testify that no one, other than Allah, deserves to be worshipped.’ The angels then gathered asking, ‘O Jibril, who is this with you?’ He replied, ‘This is Muhammad.’ They then asked, ‘Is he already commissioned to serve as the Messenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘Yes, he is commissioned.’” The Holy Prophet has said that they then came to me, welcoming with salutations and saying, “Tell your brother we salute him.” I asked them, “Do you know him?” They replied, “How can we forget him? We were made (by Allah) to establish a covenant and commitment to (follow and) support him; support you and his followers until the Day of Judgment. We look on the faces of his followers five times every day” - meaning thereby during the five times Salah (prayer). “The Messenger of Allah has said, “My Lord then gave me another forty kinds of the kinds of light of which no one was similar to the light given to me before, and increased the number of rings and chains. Then He took me up to the second heaven. The angels moved to all directions in the heaven and fell down in prostration saying, ‘Free of all defects and Most Holy is the Lord of the angels and the spirit. What is this light that is so similar to the light of our Lord?’ Jibril then said twice, ‘I testify that only Allah deserves worship. The angels gathered and said, ‘O Jibril, who is he with you?’ He (Jibril) replied, ‘He is Muhammad.’ They asked, ‘Is he commissioned (as messenger of Allah)?’ Jibril answered, ‘Yes, he is commissioned.’” The Holy prophet, has said, “They (angels) came to me as if wanting to hold me in their arms and saluted me and said, ‘Convey our salutations to you brother.’ I asked, ‘Do you know him?’ They replied, ‘Why we would not know him? We are made to establish a solemn covenant of support in your favor, in his favor and in favor of his followers until the Day of Judgment. We look at the faces of his followers five times every day and night.’ They meant thereby the times of each of five daily Salah (prayer).” The Messenger of Allah has said, “My Lord then gave me another forty kinds of the kinds of light of which no one was similar to the light given to me before. Then He took me up to the third heaven. The angels moved to all directions in the heaven and fell down in prostration saying, ‘Free of all defects and Most Holy is the Lord of the angels and the spirit. What is this light that is so similar to the light of our Lord?’ Jibril then said twice, ‘I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.’ The angels all gathered and said, ‘Welcome, we greet you, O the first. Welcome, O the last, welcome, O the one who brings about resurrection and welcome the one who brings about distribution (distributor of heavens and hell (one of the title of Imam AJi)), Muhammad is the best of the prophets and Ali is the best of the executors of the wills of the prophets of Allah.’” “The Holy Prophet has said, “They then saluted me and asked about my brother and I said, ‘He is on earth. Do you know him?’ They replied, ‘How can we forget him? We every year perform Hajj of Bayt al-Ma‘mur where there is a white board on which there are the names of Muhammad, Ali, al-Hassan, al-Husayn, all A’immah and their followers till the Day of Judgment. We congratulate them every day and night five times’ - meaning thereby the five times Salah (prayer) - ‘and they wipe their heads with their hands.’” The Holy Prophet has said, “My Lord then increased the number of the kinds of lights for me by another forty kinds of light of which no one resembled the ones given to me before. He then took me higher until I reached the fourth heaven where the angels did not say anything. I heard a low intensity sound as if vibrating inside the chests. The angels then gathered, the doors of the heaven opened and they came to welcome me. Jibril then said, ‘Come for Salah (prayer), come for Salah (prayer). Come to wellbeing, come to wellbeing.’ The angels then said, ‘They are two very familiar sounds.’ Jibril then said, ‘Salah (prayer) is about to be performed, Salah (prayer) is about to be performed.’ The angels said, ‘It is for his followers until the Day of Judgment.’ The angels then gathered and asked, ‘How is your brother?’ I replied, ‘Do you know him?’ They replied, ‘We know him and his followers. They are lights around the Throne of Allah and in al-Bayt al-Ma‘mur, there is a board of light [on which there is a writing of light] and in this writing there are the names of Muhammad, Ali, al-Hassan, al-Husayn, all ’A’immah and their followers until the Day of Judgment from whom not even one man is increased or decreased. This (written document) is our covenant and a document of commitment which is read to us every Friday.’ Thereafter it was said to me, ‘Raise your head, O Muhammad.’ I raised my head, I saw the levels of the heaven opened up, and the curtains rose. I then was told, ‘Look downward.’ I looked downward and I saw a house like your house, this one, a sacred precinct like this holy precinct. If I were to drop something down from my hand, it would only fall on this house but not on another place. It then was said to me, ‘O Muhammad, this is the holy place and you are the Holy person; for every similitude there is something similar.’ Allah then sent Wahy to me, ‘O Muhammad go near the S’ ad (a fountain at the foot of the Throne) wash the parts of your body that are used during sajdah, cleanse them and perform Salah (prayer) for the sake of your Lord.’” The Messenger of Allah then went near the S’ ad, water that flows at the right foot of the Throne. The Messenger of Allah touched the water with his right hand and for this reason Wudu’ is with the right hand. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then sent Wahy to him (Muhammad), “Wash your face; you look to My greatness, then wash your right arm and then your left arm; you receive My words (book) in your hand. Thereafter wipe your head with your hand while still moist with the water of Wudu’ and your feet up to your ankles; I like to bless you and allow you to step where no one, other than you, has ever stepped.” This is the reason for Adhan and Wudu’. Then Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent Wahy to him, “O Muhammad, face the direction of the black-stone and speak of My greatness an equal number of times as the number of My curtains.” For this reason, the number of Takbir is seven, equal to the number of seven curtains. At the end of the curtains, he commenced Salah (prayer) and for this reason, commencement became a Sunnah (a noble tradition). The curtains are of parallel levels and in between every two level, there are oceans of light. This is the light, which Allah sent to Muhammad, O Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. For this reason, the number of (Takbir for) commencement is three because of the opening of the curtains three times. The number of Takbir, (altogether before commencement), are seven and the number of commencement three times. When he completed all Takbir and (takbir of) commencement, Allah sent him Wahy to call Him by His name and for this reason, the phrase “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful” is placed before every Chapter of the Holy Quran. Then Allah sent him Wahy to praise Him. When he said, “All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds,” the Holy Prophet to himself said, “My thanks (to Allah).” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent him Wahy saying, “You just discontinued My praise. Call Me by My name.” For this reason the phrase “most Beneficent, most Merciful” has come twice in al-Hamd (Chapter 1 of the Quran). When the Holy Prophet reached the last word in al-Hamd’ he said, “All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds and all thanks.” Allah then sent him Wahy, “You discontinued speaking of Me. Call Me by My name.” For this reason, at the beginning of every Chapter there is the phrase, “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.” Thereafter Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent him Wahy, “O Muhammad, read about the relationship of your Lord, the most Holy, the most High. “(I begin) in the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. (112:1) (O Muhammad,) you must say, \"He is Allah, Who is one only (112:2). Allah is Absolute (112:3). He does not have any child nor is He a child of others (112:4). There is no one equal to Him. (112:5).” “Then Wahy was held back from him and the Messenger of Allah said, “One the only One who is self- sufficient.” Allah then sent him Wahy, “He does not have any child nor is He a child of others (112:4). There is no one equal to Him. (112:5).” Then Wahy was held back from him and the Messenger of Allah said, “Thus is Allah. Thus is Allah, our Lord.” When he said this Allah sent him Wahy, “Kneel down for Ruku‘ for the sake of your Lord, O Muhammad.” He knelt down for RukuL Allah then sent Wahy, while he was in Ruku‘ position, to say, “My Lord, the great, is free of all defects.” He said this three times, Then Allah sent him Wahy, “Raise your head, O Muhammad.” The Messenger of Allah did as he was told to do and stood up straight. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent Wahy, “Bow down in prostration for the sake of your Lord, O Muhammad.” The Messenger of Allah bowed down in prostration, then Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent Wahy, say, “My Lord, the most High, is free of all defects.” He said it three times. Then Allah sent Wahy, “Sit upright, O Muhammad.” He did as he was told. When he sat upright he looked at (signs of) His greatness that appeared to him, then, on his own he bowed down in prostration without anyone’s command. He said three times, “Allah is free of all defects.” Allah then sent Wahy that said, “Stand up straight.” He obeyed but he did not see (of the signs) of greatness that had seen before and for this reason in Salah (prayer) every Rak‘at has one Ruku‘ and two sajdah. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then sent Wahy, “Read All praise belong to Allah, Cherisher of the worlds” (the first Chapter of the Holy Quran) and he read as he had done before. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then sent Wahy, “Read Chapter 97 of the Holy Quran; this Chapter speaks, of your relationship and the relationship of your family, until the Day of Judgment.” In Ruku‘ he did just as he had done before, then he did one sajdah. When he raised his head (signs of) greatness appeared to him, he then bowed down in prostration by his own choice, without anyone’s command and again he said, “Allah is free of all defects.” Allah sent Wahy, “Raise your head, O Muhammad, your Lord has made you steadfast.” When he wanted to stand up, he was told, “Sit down in your place, O Muhammad.” He then sat down. Allah sent Wahy, “O Muhammad, when I grant you a favor, you should call Me by My name.” He was inspired to say, “In the name of Allah, with (the help of) Allah, no one, other than Allah, deserves to be worshipped, and all beautiful names belong to Allah.” Then Allah sent Wahy, “O Muhammad, ask compensation for yourself and say, ‘ Allahumma Salli ‘Ala Muhammad wa ‘Ali Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause),”’ which he did as he was told. He then noticed rows of angels and messenger and prophets of Allah and it was said to him, “O Muhammad, salute them.” He then said, “I pray to Allah to grant you peace, mercy and blessings.” Allah then sent Wahy, “You and your descendants are the peace, salutations, mercy and blessing.” Allah then sent Wahy, “Do not pay any attention to the left.” The first verse that he heard after Chapter 112 and 97 of the Holy Quran was the verse about the people of the right hand and people of the left hand. For this reason one salutation is toward the direction of Qiblah and for this reason there is Shukr (expression of thanks) in sajdah for Takbir and his saying, “Allah listens to all those who praise Him” because the Holy Prophet heard a great deal of voices of angels saying al- Tasbih, al-Tahmid and al-Tahlil. For this reason he said, “Allah listens to all of those who praise Him.” For this reason, in the first and second Rak‘at if something invalidating Wudu’ takes place, one needs to perform them all over again. This is the first obligation in the prayer at noontime, that is, Salah (prayer) at noontime.’” ",

Each Salah (prayer) consisted of two Rak‘at. When al-Hassan and al-Husayn, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, were born, the Messenger of Allah increased seven more Rak‘at in thanksgiving to Allah and Allah granted him permission to do so. He did not increase anything to the Morning Salah (prayer) due to the short duration of its time in which time the angels of the night and day also attend it. When Allah commanded him to shorten Salah (prayer) while on a journey, he decreased six Rak‘at and did not decrease anything from Maghrib (soon after sunset) Salah (prayer). The rules of how to deal with mistakes in Salah (prayer) apply to the Rak‘at that was increased by the Messenger of Allah. Thus, if one faces doubts during the first and second Rak‘at, he has to redo his Salah (prayer) from the beginning.” ",

(It is also for the) people whose hearts are inclined (toward Islam), the slaves, those who cannot pay their debts, for the cause of Allah, and for those who have become needy on a journey. Paying zakat is an obligation that Allah has decreed. Allah is All-knowing and All-wise. ’(9:60) ‘Can all the people and cases mentioned in this verse receive zakat even though they may not believe (in Divine Authority of ’A’immah)?’ He replied, ‘The Imam gives charity to all of them; they announce their obedience to him.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘Even if they do not acknowledge (his Divine Authority)?’ He then said, ‘O Zurarah, were he to give charity only to those who acknowledge (his Divine Authority) and not to others, there would remain no one or cases as recipient of (zakat) charity. He gives charity to those who do not acknowledge (his divine authority) so they incline to religion to become strong (in faith). However, today you and your friends give zakat only to those who acknowledge (our Divine Authority) if you find one who believes (in our Divine Authority).’ He then said, ‘The share of those who show interest in Islam and the share of slaves to be emancipated are of general nature and other shares in a charity are for certain people but not for everyone.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘What happens if there is no recipient of zakat?’ He replied, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has not made any charity compulsory without any recipient.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘What happens if charity is not enough?’ He replied, ‘The amount of compulsory charity Allah has sanctioned in the properties of affluent people for the poor ones is enough. If He knew that it is not enough, He would sanction a greater amount. Shortages do not come from the amount Allah has made compulsory but it comes from non-payment.

He then commanded his announcer to announce among the Muslims, “O Muslims, pay zakat on your properties; your Salah (prayer) will be accepted.’” He said, ‘Then he (the Messenger of Allah) sent his land assessor and tax collectors among people to collect zakat.’” ",

This share is zakat. Paying zakat protects their lives and because of paying zakat, they are called Muslims. However, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has assigned other shares in the properties of the affluent people, which are other than zakat. This is what a man considers necessary to pay from his property as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has mentioned in His book: ‘They are those who assign a certain share of their property (70:24) for the needy and the deprived (70:25).’ The ‘certain share’ is something other than zakat. It is what one considers necessary to pay to the needy. He must, however, do so according to his financial abilities and then pay what he has considered necessary. He may pay every day, every Friday or every month. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has also said, ‘The charitable men and women who give a virtuous loan to Allah will receive double from Him in addition to their honorable reward.’ (57:18) This also is something other than zakat. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said again, ‘. . . My believing servants . . . spend for the cause of their Lord, both in private and in public, out of what We have given them. . . .’ (14:31) Assistance is a form of loan, borrowing a certain item or lending a helping hand are also of matters Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has made necessary and they are other than zakat. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, ‘Those who fulfill their promise to and covenant with Allah (13:20), who maintain all the proper relations that Allah has commanded them to maintain, who have fear of their Lord and the hardships of the Day of Judgment’ (13:21). Those who pay what Allah has made compulsory have fulfilled their duties and have paid thanks to Allah for His bounties in his properties. In this way he has thanked Allah for what Allah has granted him and has given him preference over others as wealthier than others and has given him the opportunity to fulfill his duty toward Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and has helped him to do so.” ",

With us, there were certain wealthier persons. People spoke about zakat.

However, on your properties, payments other than zakat are also due.’ I (the narrator) than asked, ‘I pray to Allah to keep you well, what other payments, besides zakat, are due on our properties?’ He replied, ‘Allah is free of all defects. Have you not heard the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in His book, “They are those who assign a certain share of their property (70:24) for the needy and the deprived.” (70:25) I (the narrator) then asked, ‘What is the “certain share,” in our properties, due on us?’ He replied, ‘It is the amount that one pays from his property every day, or every Friday or every month in small amounts or large amounts and continues doing so. It also is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “. . . and refuse to help the needy.” (107:7) This kind of help is what one considers necessary to pay as a loan, or a favor or household items borrowed and of this kind is zakat.’ I then said, ‘We have such neighbors that on lending things to them they may break or destroy them. Is it alright if we deny them such things?’ He replied, ‘In such case you are not blamed.’ I then asked about the words of Allah, ‘They feed the destitute, orphans, and captives for the love of Allah. . .’ (76:8) He said, ‘That is not of zakat.’ I then asked about the words of Allah, Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, ‘. . . they spent their property during the night and day, publicly or privately’ (2:273) He said, ‘It is not of zakat.’ I then asked about the words of Allah, Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, ‘It is alright if you pay charity publicly but if you pay to the needy privately it is better for you.’ (2:270) The Imam said, ‘It is not of zakat.

Is there Zakat on him? He (the Imam) said, ‘No, Zakat is not due on him until a year passes and it is two hundred dirham. If it was one hundred fifty dirham and after one month he finds a fifty dirham, in this case also, Zakat is not due on him until one year passes with two hundred dirham.’ I then asked, ‘If one has two hundred dirham less one dirham and after several days and before passing of a month he finds one dirham and then one year passes with the rest of dirham with him, is there Zakat on him? He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, (there is Zakat on him). If all of it has not remained with him for one complete year Zakat is not obligatory.’ “Zurarah and Muhammad ibn Muslim have said that abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘If one has a certain amount of asset which remains with him for one year, he is required to pay its Zakat.’ I then asked him (the Imam), ‘What happens if he gives it as gift to someone, one month before the passing of one year or one day? He (the Imam) said, ‘Zakat is not due on him ever.’ Zurarah has narrated from him (the Imam) that he (the Imam) said, ‘This is like the case of one who in the month of Ramadan is at home and then travels in the end of the day intending to avoid the penalty which becomes obligatory on him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When he sees the crescent of the twelfth month Zakat becomes obligatory on him.’ He (the Imam) has said, ‘When he sees the crescent of the twelfth month Zakat is due but if he gives it as a gift earlier, it is permissible, and he is not obligated for anything in this matter like the case of one who travels and then discontinues his fast. He cannot refuse once the year passes, but he can refuse if one year is not passed. He cannot refuse to pay what belongs to others. It applies to the asset on which one year has passed.’ Zurarah has said that he then asked, ‘A man had two hundred dirham and he gives it as gift to his brothers or children or his family to avoid Zakat. He did it one month before a year is complete.’ He (the Imam) said, ’Once the twelfth month comes one year is complete and Zakat is obligatory.’ I (Zurarah) then asked, ‘Can he use it (like giving as gift) before the year is complete?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, it is permissible for him.’I then said, ‘He is avoiding Zakat.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘What he has allowed into his soul is greater than avoiding payment of Zakat.’ I said, ‘He can get it back (from the recipient of gift).’ He (the Imam) said, ‘How can you tell if he can get it back? It is out of his hand (possession) already.’ I said, ‘He can give it as conditional gift.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Once he calls it a gift it becomes a lawful commitment, the condition falls (is invalid) and he is held responsible for Zakat.’ I then asked, ‘Why does the condition fall, the gift is approved and he is responsible for Zakat?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘This is an invalid condition, commitment for the gift is made and punishment of non-payment of Zakat is necessary.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘It is for him if he purchases therewith a house or land or goods.’ Zurarah has said that he then said, ‘Your father said to me that if one by doing so avoids Zakat he must pay it.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘My father has spoken the truth. He must pay what is obligatory on him and he is not required to pay what is not obligatory up on him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Think about a man who faints for a day, then dies and his Salah (prayer) is missed. Is there any Salah (prayer) on him now that he is dead?’ I replied, ‘No, Salah (prayer) is not obligatory on him unless he gains consciousness on the same day.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘If a man becomes ill in the month of Ramadan and dies in that month, will there be fasting on his behalf?’ I replied, ‘No, it is not necessary.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘In the same way, a man is not required to pay Zakat until a year is complete.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Hariz from Burayd ibn Mu‘awiyah who has said the following: “I heard abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say, ‘’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, gave the following disciplinary instructions to a zakat collector. He (the Imam) then sent him to the suburbs of the city of al-Kufah. “O servant of Allah, set out for this task: but you must be pious before Allah who is one and has no partner. You must not give preference to your worldly matters over the matters of the next life. You must be protective of what I have entrusted you with and pay proper attention to the rights of Allah. When you arrive in the community of so and so tribe, disembark at the place, which is the source of their water. Do not mingle among their houses. Thereafter go in a dignified and honorable manner to meet them until you stand among them and say to them the expression of greeting, then say to them, ‘O servants of Allah, the person who possesses Divine Authority has sent me to ask you to pay the rights of Allah which are due on your wealth and I collect them. Is there anything of the rights of Allah due on your wealth that you must pay to the person who possesses Divine Authority?’ If anyone says, ‘No, (there is not anything due on my wealth).’ You must not ask him again. If anyone among them answered you positively, then follow him without frightening him or promising him anything but good. When you reach the location of his wealth, do not enter that place without his permission; he owns most of the wealth. Then say to him, ‘O servant of Allah, do you allow me to enter the location of your wealth?’ If he allows you, then do not enter in a dominant or rough manner. Make two sections of the wealth, then allow him to choose one section and do not interfere with the section that he chooses. Thereafter make the remaining section into two sections and again allow him to choose whichever section he chooses. You must not interfere with his choice. Continue this process until you arrive at the remaining section that is the portion of zakat, the right of Allah, the most Holy, the most High. Take possession of the portion that is the right of Allah in his wealth. If he asks you to cancel the process, you should do so. Mix and start the process all over again until you can take possession of the right of Allah from his wealth. When you take possession, then do not mishandle it. You must remain helpful, kind, trustworthy and protective of the property you have received. You must not handle anything thereof roughly. Thereafter, dispatch promptly your collection of every community to us and we will handle it according to the commandments of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. If you dispatch it through a messenger, advise him not to block or separate a camel from her young, and do not over-milk the camel to harm her young. He must not tire the camel by riding excessively. He must follow rules of justice toward them. He must allow them to drink from every source of water on the way. In the hours, which are for their grazing and rest, he must not drive them on the plain road. He must be kind and caring to them so they can reach us, by the permission of Allah in good health and condition, not tired or overworked. We then, by the permission of Allah, distribute them according to the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah among the friends of Allah. Following these instructions will allow you to have greater reward and it is closer to the dictate of your reason. Allah looks upon you and these properties, and upon your hard work, good advice to your commander who has commissioned you for the task. The Messenger of Allah has said, ‘Whoever, for the sake of Allah, pays attention to his guardian, works hard obediently and gives good advice to him (guardian) and to his Imam, in the company of the high position, he will join our company.”” He (narrator) has said, ‘Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, wept and said, “O Burayd, by Allah, all respectable matters of Allah have already been disregarded. The book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah are not followed in this world any more. Nothing of the laws of justice is maintained in this world after the passing away of Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al- Salam. Nothing of the laws of truth has ever since been followed.” He then said, “I swear by Allah, days and night will not end until Allah will give life to the dead, cause the living to die, return the truth to the people of truth, and establish His religion which He has chosen for Himself and for His prophet. It is glad news for you. It indeed is glad news for you. Without any doubt, it is glad news for you. I swear by Allah, Truth does not exist anywhere in any place except in your hands.’”” ",
