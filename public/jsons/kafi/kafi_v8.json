Muhammad Ibn Yaqub Al-Kulayni has narrated that, ‘Narrated to me Ali Ibn Ibrahim from his father from Ibn FaddAl-from Hafs al-Mu’Adhdhin from Abu Abdullah (asws) as well as Muhammad Ibn ’Ismail Ibn Bazi’ from Muhammad Ibn Sinan from ’Ismail Ibn Jabir that - ‘Abu Abdullah (asws), wrote this letter to his (asws) companions and commanded them to study it, ponder over it, and make a pact by it, and act in accordance with. They used to keep it in their places of Prayer in their homes. So when they were free from their Prayers, they would look into it’. He said, ‘Narrated to me A-Hassan Ibn Muhammad, from Ja’far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Malik al-Kufiy from al-Qasim Ibn Al-Rabi’ Al-Sahhaf from ’Ismail Ibn Mukhallad Al-Sarraj from Abu Abd Allah (asws). He said that, ‘I brought out this letter of Abu Abdullah (asws) to his (asws) companions – ‘In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Having said that, I (asws) ask your Lord (azwj) to grant you all good health. It is for you all to have tenderness, dignity and tranquility, and it is for you to be bashful and keep yourselves clear, just as the righteous people before you have done. It is for you to be courteous with the people of falsehood. You will bear injustices from them, and beware of disputing with them in what is between you and them. When you sit with them, and are alone with them and argue your differences with them, there is no way out for you but to sit with them and be alone with them, and argue with them by the dissimulation which Allah (azwj) has Ordered you for, that you should take to it regarding what is between you and them. So if you are tested with that from them, that they wish to harm you and you can recognise abhorrence in their faces, and if Allah (azwj), the High does not Dispel them away from you, they would rob you. And what is in their chests of enmity and hatred is much more than what they display to you. Your gatherings and their gatherings are one and the same, but your spirits and their spirits are different. You will not reconcile with them and you will never lover them, ever, and they will never love you as well. Surely Allah (azwj) the High has Honoured you all with the truth and Made you to visualise it, and did not Make them to be deserving of it. Be courteous to them and be patient with them, for they have no courtesy to you nor do they have patience over anything, and some of them are obsessed with tricking the others, for the enemies of Allah (azwj) have the ability to keep you from the truth. Allah (azwj) Protects you from that, so fear Allah (azwj) and hold back your tongues except from the good, and beware of letting your tongues to slip into speaking that which is false, and the slanderous, and the sinful, and the violation. So if you were to hold back your tongues from what is disliked by Allah (azwj), from what He (azwj) has Forbidden you from, it would be better for you with your Lord (azwj) than letting your tongues slip into what is disliked by Him (azwj) and what He (azwj) has Prohibited you from. There is destruction for the servant, with Allah (azwj), and Repugnance from Allah (azwj), and there will be deafness, and blindness, and muteness which Allah (azwj) will Make him to inherit on the Day of Judgement. So they will become just as Allah (azwj) has said: “[2:18] Deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they will not turn back”, it means that they will not be speaking and will not have the Permission to present their excuses. And beware from what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited you from doing, and it is for you to remain silent except with regards to what Allah (azwj) has Benefited you by from the matters of your Hereafter and be Rewarded by Him (azwj). And be frequent in Extolling His (azwj) Holiness, and Glorification, and the Praising to Allah (azwj), and the desires for what is with Him (azwj) from the Good which cannot be estimated, nor can anyone reach it (imagine), so occupy your tongues with that in order to avoid the false speech which would lead its owners to an eternity in the Fire for the one who dies upon it and does not repent to Allah (azwj), and does not keep away from it. And it is for you to supplicate, for the Muslims cannot be successful in the fulfilment of their wishes with their Lord (azwj) by any means higher than supplication and desiring from Him (azwj), and appealing to Allah (azwj), and the asking from Him (azwj). So be desirous in what you request to Allah (azwj) so that He (azwj) would Answer you to what you have supplicated to Him (azwj) in order to be successful and be saved from the Punishment of Allah (azwj). And beware of being greedy for yourselves to something from what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited to you. For the one who violates what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited to him here in the world, Allah (azwj) would Place a block between him and the Paradise, and its Bounties, and its enjoyments, and its Prestige which will stand for all eternity for the inhabitants of the Paradise, for ever and ever. And know that it is an evil misfortune for the one who takes the risk of endangering the obedience to Allah (azwj) the Blessed, and to be disobedient to Him (azwj). So the choosing to violate what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited from the pleasures of the world would cut its people off from the eternal-Bliss in the Paradise, and its pleasures, and the prestige of its inhabitants. Woe be unto those! What a frustration they will face when they lose, and evil would be their condition with their Lord (azwj) on the Day of Judgement. Seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) that He (azwj) would Protect you from being in a situation similar to theirs forever, and be in afflictions like their afflictions. And there is no Might with us (asws) or with you except by Him (azwj). So, fear Allah (azwj), O group of saved people, that Allah (azwj) will Complete for you what He (azwj) has Granted you with, for the matter will not be complete until He (azwj) Makes you to enter into similar of what came upon the righteous ones before you, and until you face tribulation with regards to yourselves and your wealth, and until you hear from the enemies of Allah (azwj), a lot of painful words. So, observe patience and take it in your stride, and even if they humiliate you, and hate you, and even if they burden you with injustices. So bear these from them, seeking by that the Face of Allah (azwj) and the House of the Hereafter, and until you control your intense anger in the suffering for the sake of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. They will incriminate you, and even belie you about the truth, and be inimical towards you with regards to it, and be hateful towards you. So, observe patience on that from them, and all that has been Ratified in the Book of Allah (azwj) which Jibraeel (as) Descended with upon your Prophet (saww), getting your Prophet (saww) to hear the Words of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[46:35] Therefore bear up patiently as did the messengers endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom).” Then He (azwj) Said: “[35:4] And if they call you a liar, truly messengers before you were called liars”. So observe patience on what they lie about and hurt you with, for they had belied the Prophet (saww) of Allah (azwj), and the Messengers (as) from before him (saww), and hurt them along with the denial of the truth. And if you are happy with the Commands of Allah (azwj) regarding them (asws) whom Allah (azwj) Created for Himself (zwj) in the Beginning (beginning of the creation), from the infidelity which has preceded in the Knowledge of Allah (azwj) that He (azwj) Created them in the origin and the ones whom Allah (azwj) has Named in His (azwj) book in His (azwj) Words: “[28:41] And We made them Imams who call to the fire”. So, ponder over this and hold on to it, and do not be ignorant of it, for the one who is ignorant of this and the like of this which Allah (azwj) has Made to be Obligatory in His (azwj) Book from what Allah (azwj) has Ordered for and Prohibited from, has disregarded the Religion of Allah (azwj) and became disobedient to Him (azwj). Therefore he has necessitated (upon himself) the Outrage of Allah (azwj), and Allah (azwj) will Fling him into the Fire upon his face’. And he (asws) said: ‘O you group of Blessed ones, the victorious ones! Surely, Allah (azwj) Completed for you what He (azwj) Granted you all from the good, and know that it is not from the Knowledge of Allah (azwj), nor from His (azwj) Commands that any one from the creatures of Allah (azwj), should take to opinions or analogies regarding his Religion. Allah (azwj) Has Sent down the Quran and Made to be in it an explanation of all things, and Assigned for the Quran and the teaching of the Quran, its People (asws). There is no leeway for the People (asws) of knowledge of the Quran whom (asws) Allah (azwj) had Given to them of its Knowledge, that they (asws) should take to desires, or opinions, or analogies with regards to it. Allah (azwj) has Made them (asws) to be needless from that by what He (azwj) has Given them (asws) from His (azwj) Knowledge, and Specialised them (asws) by it, and Placed in it Prestige from Allah (azwj) to Honour them (asws) by. And they (asws) are the People (asws) of the Remembrance (Ahl Al-Zikr) whom Allah (azwj) has Ordered the people to ask them (asws), and they (asws) are the ones (asws) to be asked. And it has preceded in the Knowledge of Allah (azwj) that they should ratify them (asws), and follow their (asws) footsteps. He (azwj) Guided them (asws), and Gave them (asws) from the Knowledge of the Quran with which they (asws) guide (others) to Allah (azwj) by His (azwj) Permission, and to all the ways of the truth. And they (asws) are the ones (asws) that He (azwj) does not Want them to be released from, and from asking them (asws), and from being taught by them (asws) which Allah (azwj) has Honoured them (asws) with and Made it to be with them (asws), except for the one who has preceded in the Knowledge of Allah (azwj), as being the miserable one in the origin of the creation underneath the shadow. So these are the ones who turn away from asking the People (asws) of the Remembrance (Ahl Al-Zikr) and the ones (asws) to whom Allah (azwj) has Granted the Knowledge of the Quran and Placed it in their (asws) possession, and Ordered for asking them (asws). These are the ones who act on their desires, and their opinions, and their analogies to the extent that Satan (la) enters them, (as a result) they (try) to revert the believing people, in the Knowledge of the Quran with Allah (azwj), as disbelievers, and try to make the misguided people, in the Knowledge of the Quran with Allah (azwj), as believer, but to the extent that they declare what Allah (azwj) has Made Permissible, in many matters as being prohibited, and pronounce what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited, in many matters as being permissible. So this is the origin of the fruit of their desires. And the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had taken an oath from them before his (saww) passing away. So they said, ‘After Allah (azwj) Captures His (azwj) Messenger (saww), we have the leeway of taking to the consensus of the opinions of the people. After Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Captured His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and after his (saww) oath which he (saww) took from us (asws), and ordered us (asws) by, they opposed Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww). So what is more audacious to Allah (azwj), nor any clear misguidance from the one who takes to that, and alleges that it gives him the leeway to do it? By Allah (azwj), surely Allah (azwj) has Obligated His (azwj) creatures that they should obey Him (azwj), and follow His (azwj) Commands during the lifetime of Muhammad (saww), and after his (saww) passing away. Can those enemies of Allah (azwj) who are alleging that anyone who became a Muslim with Muhammad (saww), can take to his own words, and his own opinions, and his own analogies? But if he says, ‘Yes, then, surely, he has lied to Allah (azwj) and has strayed a far straying, and if he says, ‘No, it is not for anyone that he should take to his opinions, and his desires, and his analogies’, so he has argued against himself, and he is from the ones who allege that Allah (azwj) has to be Obeyed, and His (azwj) Orders to be followed after the passing away of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj). Allah (azwj) has said, and His (azwj) words are true: “[3:144] And Muhammad is no more than a messenger; the messengers have already passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful”, and that is something which they knew that Allah (azwj) is to be obeyed and His (azwj) Commands are to be followed during the lifetime of Muhammad (saww), and (as well as) after Allah (azwj) had Made Muhammad (saww) to pass away. And if it was not for anyone from the people who were with Muhammad (saww) that they would take to their own desires, and their opinions, and their analogies in opposition to the orders of Muhammad (saww), so similarly it is not for anyone from the people after Muhammad (saww) that they would take to their own desires, and their opinions, and their analogies’. And he (asws) said: ‘Leave the raising of your hands in the Prayer except for the one time when you open the Prayer, for the people have publicised you all by that, and Allah (azwj) is the Helper, and there is no Might and there is no Power except by Allah (azwj)’. And he (asws) said: ‘Supplicate frequently to Allah (azwj) for Allah (azwj) Loves the ones from the believing servants that they should supplicate to Him (azwj), and Allah (azwj) has Promised the believing servants for the Answering, and Allah (azwj) has Destined the supplications of the Believers, on the Day of Judgement, to increase their deeds by it in the Paradise. So, frequently remember Allah (azwj) in accordance with your abilities in every hour of the hours of the night and the day, for Allah (azwj) has Ordered for frequent Remembrance (Al-Zikr) to Him (azwj), and Allah (azwj) Remembers the one who remembers Him (azwj) from the Believers. And know, that Allah (azwj) never Remembers anyone from His (azwj) believing servant except Remembering him with Goodness. So give Allah (azwj) from yourselves, the struggle in obedience to Him (azwj), for Allah (azwj) does not Accept anything from the good with Him (azwj) except by obedience to Him (azwj), and the avoidance of His (azwj) Prohibitions which Allah (azwj) has Prohibited in the apparent of the Quran and in its hidden. Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Said in His (azwj) Book, and His (azwj) Words are True: “[6:120] And abandon open and secret sin”. And know that whatever Allah (azwj) has Ordered you to avoid, so He (azwj) has Prohibited it, and follow the footsteps of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and his (saww) Sunnah, so adhere to it and do not follow your own desires, and your opinions, for you will go astray. The most misguided of the people with Allah (azwj) is the one who follows his own desires and his opinion without (following the) Guidance from Allah (azwj). And do good for yourselves in accordance with your abilities, for if you do good, it would be for your own selves, and if you violate, it would be against your own selves. And intermingle with the people and do not burden them upon your necks, including along with that the obedience to your Lord (azwj). And beware of insulting the enemies of Allah (azwj) when they are listening to you, for the enemies will insult Allah (azwj) without awareness, and it is better that you should know the penalty of insulting Allah (azwj) and what it is. He who has insulted the friends of Allah (azwj) is like he has insulted Allah (azwj). And the one who is the most unjust with Allah (azwj) is the one who insults Allah (azwj) and the friends of Allah (azwj), so don’t do it, don’t do it. Follow the Commands of Allah (azwj). There is no Might, and no Power except by Allah (azwj)’. And he (asws) said: ‘O you group for whom Allah (azwj) has Protected for them their affairs! It is for you to follow the footsteps of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) and his (saww) Sunnah, and the footsteps of the Imams (asws) of Guidance from the People (asws) of the Household of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) from after him (saww) and their (asws) Sunnah. So the one who takes to that has been guided, and the one who avoided that and abandoned it, went astray, because they (asws) are the ones (asws) for whom Allah (azwj) Commanded (the people) to be obedient to, and for their (asws) Wilayah. And our (asws) father (asws) the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) has said: ‘The continuation upon the deeds in the following of the footsteps and the Sunnah, even though they may be little, is more Pleasing to Allah (azwj) and beneficial with Him (azwj) in the Rewards, than the struggle in the ‘Bittah) heresy, and the desires. Indeed, the following of the desires, and the following of the heresies (innovations) without Guidance from Allah (azwj) is misguidance, and every misguidance is heresy, and every heretic will be in the Fire. And nothing can be achieved from the good with Allah (azwj) except by being obedient to Him (azwj), and the patience and being agreeable, because the patience and being agreeable is from the obedience to Allah (azwj). And know, that a servant from the servants has not believed until he is happy with Allah (azwj) with regards to whatever Allah (azwj) has Done for him, and what he has done for Him (azwj) in accordance with what He (azwj) Likes and Dislikes. And Allah (azwj) does not Do with the one who is patient and happy with Allah (azwj) except that which he is deserving of, and that which is better for him, from what he likes or dislikes. And it is for you to “[2:238] Attend constantly to prayers and to the middle prayer and stand up truly obedient to Allah”, just as Allah (azwj) has Commanded the Believers in His (azwj) Book which is in front of you. And beware, and it is for you to love the poor Muslims, for the one who considers them to be lowly due to his own arrogance, so he has slipped from the Religion of Allah (azwj), and Allah (azwj) has for him (a situation of) lowliness and hate. And the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) has said: ‘My (saww) Lord (azwj) has Commanded me (saww) to love the poor among the Muslims’. And know, that the one who belittles anyone from the Muslims will meet Allah (azwj) having Hatred towards him and lowliness from Him (azwj) to the extent that the people will hate him and Allah (azwj) will have intense Hatred towards him. Fear Allah (azwj) with regards to your brothers who are poor Muslims, for they have a right over you that you should love them. Allah (azwj) Commanded His (azwj) Messenger (saww) to love them, so the one who does not love the one whom Allah (azwj) has Commanded to love, so he has disobeyed Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and the one who disobeys Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww) and dies upon that, would have died whilst being from the misguided ones. And beware of (considering for yourself) greatness and arrogance, for the Arrogance is the Robe of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, so the one who disputed with Allah (azwj) for His (azwj) Robe, Allah (azwj) will Reduce him and Disgrace him on the Day of Judgement. And beware of injustices of some of you against the others, for it is not from the characteristics of the righteous. The one who is unjust, Allah (azwj) will Turn his injustice against his own self, and Make His (azwj) Help to be for the one who he was unjust to, and the one whom Allah (azwj) Helps will overcome and be of the group of winners from Allah (azwj). And beware of the envying of some of you against the others, for the disbelief is the origin of the envy. And beware of helping against an oppressed Muslim, for he would supplicate to Allah (azwj) against you and He (azwj) would Answer him regarding you. Our (asws) forefather (saww) the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) used to say that: ‘The supplication of an oppressed Muslims gets Answered’. And help each other, for our (asws) forefather (saww), the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) used to say that: ‘Helping a Muslim is better and greater in Reward than the Fasting for a month, and seclusion (Al-I’tikaaf) in the Masjid Al-Haraam (The Sacred Masjid). And beware of creating difficulties for anyone from your Muslim brothers if he owes you anything from before and he is insolvent, for our (asws) forefather the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) used to say: ‘It is not for a Muslim to make difficulties for a Muslim, and the one who is considerate to the insolvent will be Shaded by Allah (azwj) by a shade on the Day in which there will no shade except for His (azwj) Shade’. And beware, O group under the Mercy and preferred ones over the others, of withholding the Rights of Allah (azwj) before you, day after day and hour after hour, for the one who makes haste in (giving) the Rights of Allah (azwj) which are in front of him, then Allah (azwj) has the Power over the Hastening to him for the multiplication of the good, either immediately or later on. And the one who delays the Rights of Allah (azwj), then Allah (azwj) has the Power over Delaying his sustenance, and the one from whom Allah (azwj) Withholds his sustenance, he would not have the ability to sustain himself. So give to Allah (azwj) the Right from what He (azwj) has Granted you so that He (azwj) would Purify for you the remainder of it, and Complete for you from the Multiplication for you, the excessive Multiplication, the count of which is not known to any but Him (azwj), or its virtues, the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds’. And he (asws) said: ‘Fear Allah (azwj), O group, if you could, and dont be an embarrassment for the Imam (asws), for the one who causes embarrassment for the Imam (asws), he is the one who discredits the righteous people, the ones who follow the Imam (asws) of the Muslims for his (asws) virtues, the patient ones upon the payment of his (asws) rights, the ones who understand his (asws) sanctity. And know, that the one who descends to that level with (respect) the Imam (asws), so he has embarrassed the Imam (asws) (by associating himself with him (asws)) He would do that by cursing the righteous people the ones who (strictly) follow him (asws) from the Muslims for their virtues, the patient ones upon the paying of his (asws) rights, the ones who have recognised his (asws) sanctity, so his curse against (the pious ones) is for the enemies of Allah (azwj), as the Imam (asws) converts that curse into Mercy from Allah (azwj) upon them (the pious ones), and turns the Curse from Allah (azwj) and from the Angels, and from His (azwj) Messenger (saww) upon them (the deniers). And know, O group, that the Sunnah from Allah (azwj) has flowed within the righteous ones before’. And he (asws) said: ‘The one who wishes to meet Allah (azwj) as a Believer, ‘Haqqan’ Haqqan’ (surely and truly), so he should befriend Allah (azwj), and His (azwj) Messenger, and those who believed (asws), and should distance himself from their (asws) enemies, and accept whatever that has ended up with him from their (asws) virtues, because their (asws) virtues cannot be comprehended by the ‘مَلَكٌ مُقَرَّبٌ’ Angels of Proximity, or ‘نَبِيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ’ the Messenger Prophets (as), but some among them. Have you not heard what Allah (azwj) has Mentioned from the virtues of following the Imams (asws) of Guidance, and they are the Believers? He (azwj) Said: “[4:69] And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, these are with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favors from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good, and a goodly company are they!” This is just one perspective from the perspectives of the virtues of following the Imams (asws), so how can others (comprehend) them (asws) and their (asws) virtues? And the one who wishes that Allah (azwj) should Complete for him his faith and he becomes a devout and true Believer, he should fulfill to Allah (azwj) His (azwj) Conditions which He (azwj) has Placed upon the Believers. He (azwj) has Placed the conditions of His (azwj) Wilayah along with the Wilayah of His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and the Wilayah of the Imams (asws) of the Believers. He should establish the Prayer, and give the Zakaat, and give to Allah (azwj) goodly loans (Karza e Hasana), and avoid the immoralities, both openly as well as discreetly. There does not remain anything from the detail of what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited, except that it is included in its entirety in His (azwj) Statement. So the one who makes it to be his Religion in what is between himself and Allah (azwj), being sincere to Allah (azwj), and does not authorise for himself to ignore anything from this, so he is, in the Sight of Allah (azwj), in His (azwj) Triumphant Party, and he is from the true Believers. And beware of insisting upon something from what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited in the Apparent of the Quran and its Hidden. And Allah (azwj) the High has Said: “[3:135] and (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done” (Up to this point it is the narration of Al-Qasim Bin Rabi’e). It means that the Believers before them, when they forgot something from what Conditions Allah (azwj) had Placed upon them in His (azwj) Book, would come to the realisation that they had disobeyed Allah (azwj) in their avoidance of that thing. So they would seek Forgiveness and would not repeat it. So that is the meaning of the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[3:135] and (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done”. And know that He (azwj) has Commanded and Prohibited, so that there should be obedience in what He (azwj) has Commanded for, and avoidance in what He (azwj) has Prohibited from. So the one who has followed His (azwj) Commands has obeyed Him (azwj), and has realised everything from the good, which is with Him (azwj), and the one who did not avoid what Allah (azwj) has Prohibited from, so he has disobeyed Him (azwj). So if he were to die upon being disobedient to Him (azwj), Allah (azwj) will Fling him upon his face in the Fire. And know, that there is nothing else between Allah (azwj) and anyone from His (azwj) creatures, Angels of Proximity, or Messenger Prophets (as), or all others apart from that, except for their obedience to Him (azwj). So strive in being obedient to Allah (azwj), if you wish to become true Believers, truly, and there is not Strength except by Allah (azwj)’. And he (asws) said: ‘And it is for you to obey your Lord (azwj) in accordance with your abilities, for Allah (azwj) is your Lord (azwj). And know that the Islam is the submission, and the submission is the Islam. So the one who submits, so he has Islam, and the one who does not submit, there is no Islam to him. And the one wishes to do himself a favour, so he should obey Allah (azwj), for the one who has obeyed Allah (azwj) has indeed done himself a favour. And beware of being disobedient to Allah (azwj) if you were to do it. The one who violated by being disobedient to Allah (azwj), so he has disfavoured himself, and there is no station between favour and disfavour. For the ones who have done a favour in the Sight of their Lord (azwj), is Paradise, and for the ones who have violated in the Sight of their Lord (azwj), is the Fire. So, know that you have to be obedient to Allah (azwj) and avoid being disobedient to Him (azwj). And know, that there is none who is needless of Allah (azwj) from His (azwj) creatures, neither the Angels of Proximity, nor the Messenger Prophets (as), nor anyone other than that. So the one who wishes that he should benefit from the intercession of the intercessors in the Presence of Allah (azwj), so he should seek to Please Allah (azwj). And know that no one from the creatures of Allah (azwj) can achieve the Pleasure of Allah (azwj) except by being obedient to Him (azwj), and being obedient to His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and being obedient to the Masters of the Command (asws) (Wali Al-Amr (asws)) from the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and that the disobedience to them (asws) is disobedient to Allah (azwj). And do not deny their (asws) virtues, be they great or small. And know, that the deniers are the liars, they are the hypocrites, and that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said for the hypocrites, and His (azwj) Words are true, that: “[4:145] Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest stage of the fire and you shall not find a helper for them”. And let no one from among you, whom Allah (azwj) has Necessitated upon his heart, obedience to Him (azwj) and being humble to Him (azwj), should fear any one from the people from whom Allah (azwj) has Removed the qualities of the truth and did not Make him to be deserving of it. So the one whom Allah (azwj) has not Made to be deserving of the qualities of the truth, so these are the hypocrites, these are the Satans (la) among the Humans and the Jinn. And it is the Satans (la) among the Humans that trick, and plot, and deceive, and whisper (cast doubts) from some of them to the others, attempting to divert the people of the truth, whom Allah (azwj) has Honoured by Granting them the insight into the Religion of Allah (azwj), and insight which Allah (azwj) has not Considered the Satans (la) among the Humans to be deserving of it, Intending thereby not to equalise the enemies of Allah (azwj) to the people of the truth, with regards to the doubt, and the denial, and the belying to end up being equal as Allah (azwj) the High has Described in His (azwj) Book: “[4:89] They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike”. Then Allah (azwj) prohibited the people of the truth that they should take the enemies of Allah (azwj) as guardians or as helpers. So do not let them scare you, and do not let them repulse you all from the consideration by the truth which Allah (azwj) has Specialised you with from the tricks of the Satans (la) from the Humans, and their plots in your affairs. You should repel the bad by that which is good in what is between you and them, seeking by that the Pleasure of your Lord (azwj) by being obedient to Him (azwj). And they are such that there is no good with them. It is not permissible for you to display to them the Principles of the Religion of Allah (azwj) (Usool Al-Deen) for they are such that they would hear something from you, be inimical against you, and raise (the issue) against you, and strive for destroying you, and place in front of you that which you dislike. And there is no remedy for you from them in the government of the corrupts. So understand your status in what is between you and the people of the falsehood, for it does not befit the people of the truth to descend to the level of the people of the falsehood. (This is due to the fact) that Allah (azwj) did not Make for the people of the falsehood who does not understand His (azwj) Perspective, the status which is with Him (azwj) for the people of the truth. The Statement of Allah (azwj) in His (azwj) Book where He (azwj) Said: “[38:28] Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right?” He (azwj) has Honoured yourselves rather than the people of the falsehood. And do not make Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and for Him (azwj) is the Highest Example, and your Imams (asws), and the Religion which you have made it to be for yourselves, to be exposed (vulnerable) to the people of the falsehood. Allah (azwj) would be Angered against you, so you will perish. So, do not do it, do not do it (strictly observe Taqeeya). O righteous people! Do not abandon the Commands of Allah (azwj), and the Command from your affairs for the obedience to Him (azwj), lest Allah (azwj) Alters the Blessings for you. Love for the sake of Allah (azwj) (the ones of similar qualities to yourselves), and hate for the Sake of Allah (azwj) the ones who oppose you. And extend your cordiality and your advice to the ones who possess your qualities, and do not extend it to the ones who have abandoned your qualities, and are inimical towards you, and rebel against you, and wish for calamities to befall upon you. This is our (asws) education which Allah (azwj) Has Educated us (asws) with. So take to it, and understand it and fetter it (to yourselves), and do not throw it behind your backs, whatever is compatible with your guidance and take to it, and whatever is along the lines of your own desires, discard it and do not follow it. And beware of the arrogance against Allah (azwj), and know that a servant is not afflicted by the arrogance against Allah (azwj) except that he is arrogant against the Religion of Allah (azwj). Be upright for the Sake of Allah (azwj) and do not turn back upon your heels, for your will have turn back as losers. May Allah (azwj) Protect us. And beware from the arrogance against Allah (azwj), and there is not strength for us (asws) or for you except by Allah (azwj)’. And he (asws) said: ‘If Allah (azwj) had Created a servant originally, in the original creation as a Believer, he will never die until Allah (azwj) Makes him to detest the evil and he distances himself from it, and the one whom Allah (azwj) has Made to detest the evil and he distances himself from it, Allah (azwj) will Cure him from the arrogance and the forcefulness which has entered into him. So his nature becomes soft, and his morals beautiful, and his face bright, and the reverence of Islam comes to him, and tranquility, and the humbleness, and he restrains himself from the Prohibitions of Allah (azwj) and avoids His (azwj) Harshness. And Allah (azwj) Grants to him the sustenance of the cordiality of the people, and intermingling with them, and avoidance of the cutting off from the people, and the rivalries, and does not get involved with anything from it or the likes of it in anything. However, if Allah (azwj) had Created a servant originally, in the original creation as an infidel, he will never die until he loves the evil and goes near to it. So if the evil becomes beloved to him and he goes near to it, he gets involved in the infidelity, and the forcefulness. So his heart hardens, and his morals deteriorate, and his face darkens, his immorality gets displayed, and his shame becomes little, and Allah (azwj) Uncovers his veil, and he rides upon the Prohibitions. So he never ceases from these tendencies and rides upon the disobedience to Allah (azwj), and hates to obey Him (azwj), and the obedient ones. So the condition of the Believers and the condition of the infidel are in contradiction. Ask Allah (azwj) for health, and seek it from Him (azwj), and there is not Might nor Strength except by Allah (azwj). Observe patience upon the afflictions in the world if you are followed by the afflictions, and intensify the obedience to Allah (azwj), and His (azwj) Wilayah, and the Wilayah of the ones (asws) He (azwj) has Commanded for, it is the better result with Allah (azwj) in the Hereafter, than the kingdom of the world, even though its bounties, and its flowers, and its affluence may be prolonged in the disobedience to Allah (azwj), and in the Wilayah of the one (asws) whom Allah (azwj) has Forbidden from being in his Wilayah, and in his obedience. Allah (azwj) has Commanded for the Wilayah of the Imams (asws) whom Allah (azwj) has Names in His (azwj) Book in His (azwj) Statement: “[21:73] And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command” and they (asws) are the ones (asws) for whom (asws) Allah (azwj) has Commanded the Wilayah for, and to be in their (asws) obedience. And the ones whom Allah (azwj) has Forbidden to be in their wilayah, these are the imams of misguidance, for whom Allah (azwj) has Decreed for them the governance in the world over the friends of Allah (azwj) and the Imams (asws) from the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww). They act in disobedience to Allah (azwj) in their governments, and in disobedience to His (azwj) Messenger (saww) so that the Words of the Punishment become reality against them, and that you can end up being with the Prophet (saww) of Allah (azwj) Muhammad (saww) and the Messengers (as) before him (saww). So ponder over what stories Allah (azwj) has Related to you in His (azwj) Book of the trials which the His (azwj) Prophets (as) were Tested by, and the Believers followed them (sa). Then ask Allah (azwj) to Grant you patience upon the affliction in the thick and thin, and the difficulties, and the prosperity, similar to which was Given to them. And beware of debating with the people of the falsehood. And it is for you to follow the guidance of the righteous ones, and their dignified (manners), and their tranquility, and their forbearance, and their humbleness, and their distancing themselves from the Prohibitions of Allah (azwj), and their truthfulness, and their loyalty, and their struggle for the Sake of Allah (azwj) in the deeds by being obedient to Him (azwj). So if you were not to do that, then you will never rise to the status of the righteous ones from before you have with your Lord (azwj). And know that if Allah (azwj) Intends good for a servant, He (azwj) opens his chest for the Islam. So He (azwj) Grants him that he will speak the truth by his tongue, and bind his heart to him so that he will act in accordance with it. So if Allah (azwj) Gathers that to him, He (azwj) Completes for him, his Islam, and if he were to die whilst being upon that, he would have died as being one of the true Muslims. And if Allah (azwj) does not Intend good for a servant, He (azwj) Leaves him to his own self, and his chest becomes constricted and an embarrassment for him. If a true (word) flows from his tongue, his heart does not accept it from him, and if his heart does not accept it from him, he does not follow Allah (azwj) and acts in accordance with it. So if that is gathered to him until he dies whilst being upon that condition, he, then, will be of the hypocrites with Allah (azwj). And all that flowed upon his tongues from the truth which he did not follow Allah (azwj) and his heart did not accept it from him, and he did not act in accordance with it, would be a proof against him on the Day of Judgement. So fear Allah (azwj) and ask Him (azwj) that He (azwj) should Open your chests for the Islam, and that He (azwj) should Make your tongues to speak with the truth until you die whilst being upon that, and that He (azwj) should Make your return (to the Hereafter to be like the) returning of the righteous ones before you. And there is not Strength except by Allah (azwj), and Praise is due to Allah (azwj) the Lord (azwj) of the worlds. And the one who wishes that he should know whether Allah (azwj) Loves him, so he should act in obedience to Allah (azwj) and follow us (asws). Have you not heard the Words of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic to His (azwj) Prophet (saww): “[3:31] Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your faults, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful” By Allah (azwj), no servant will be in obedience to Allah (azwj) ever until Allah (azwj) Makes him to be included along with obedience to Him (azwj), obedience to us (asws). And, by Allah (azwj), no servant will be following us (asws) ever until Allah (azwj) Loves him. And, by Allah (azwj), no servant leaves following us (asws) ever except that he hates us (asws). And, by Allah (azwj), no one ever hates us (asws) except that he disobeys Allah (azwj). And the one who dies whilst being in disobedience to Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) will Disgrace him and Fling him upon his face in the Fire. And Praise is due to Allah (azwj), the Lord (azwj) of the worlds’.",

        "englishText": "2. Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, altogether from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Malik Bin Atiyya, from Abu Hamza who said, ‘I have not heard of anyone who was more ascetic (pious) than Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) except for what has reached to me from Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws)’. Abu Hamza said, ‘Whenever Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) spoke regarding the ascetism (self restrain), those who were present with him (asws) , (their eyes) would be filled with tears’. Abu Hamza said, ‘And I read a Parchment in which was the speech on ascetism from the speeches of Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws), and I wrote down what was in it. Then I came to Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws), so I presented what was in it to him (asws). He (asws) recognised it, and corrected (my mistakes) from what I had (in my notes)’. In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Allah (azwj) is sufficient for us (asws). And beware of the plots of the unjust ones, and the rebellion of the envious ones, and the threats of the aggressors. O you Believers! Do not be deceived by the tyrants and those who follow them, from the people who covet this world, those that are inclined towards it, those who have been deceived by it, those who go towards it, and to its lifeless ruins, and its chaff which will be defunct tomorrow. And be cautious of what Allah (azwj) has Cautioned you from it, and abstain with regards to what Allah (azwj) has Told you to abstain from it, and do not incline towards what is in this world, inclining like the ones who has taken it to be as a house for permanent dwelling. By Allah (azwj), that which is in it is evidence for you and a warning from the changing of its days, and its conditions, and its examples, and it’s playing with its people. It raises the fallen one and degrades the honourable one, and it will return its people to the Fire tomorrow. In it, there is a significant learning and warning, that the affairs which you come across every day and night from the darkness of the strife, and the new innovations, and the unjust traditions, and the commotions of the era, and the dignity of the Sultan, and the whisperings of the Satan (la), all discourage the hearts from taking lessons from it, and boggle it from finding guidance, and the recognition of the people of the truth, except for a few whom Allah (azwj) has Protected. There is no one who will understand the changing of its days, and the alteration of its conditions, and hurtful consequences of its strife except for the one who is Protected by Allah (azwj), and Makes him to approach the way of guidance, and travels on the road purposefully. Then (he obtains) help against that by the ascetism, frequent thinking, paying attention to patience in order to notice the warning, and abstain from the immediate delights of the world, and defy its pleasures, and desire the Eternal Bliss of the Hereafter, and strive for it a striving. And he monitors the (approach of) death and passing away of the life with the unjust people. He looks at what is in the world with an illuminated vision, and the strife-taking place, and the misguidance of the innovations, and the injustices of the unjust kings. By my (asws) life, you have matters from the past which were from days in which were free from strife, pre-occupations and engagements which have evidenced for you on avoiding the misguided and the people of innovation (Heretics) who rebel and create mischief in the earth without any right to do so. So seek Help from Allah (azwj) and return to the obedience of Allah (azwj) and the obedience of the one (asws) who is the foremost for the obedience and to be followed and obeyed. So beware of the danger before the remorse and the regret before proceeding to Allah (azwj) and the pausing in front of Him (azwj), and no people ever went to Allah (azwj) after having disobeyed Him (azwj) except to His (azwj) Punishment, and no people preferred the world over the Hereafter at all except that evil was their return, and evil was their journey. The Knowledge, by Allah (azwj) and the deeds are nothing but two harmonious matters. So the one who recognises Allah (azwj) fears Him (azwj), and the fear urges him to the deeds in obedience to Allah (azwj) and that the heads of the knowledge and those that follow them recognise Allah (azwj) so they work (do deeds) for Him (azwj) and desire towards Him (azwj), and Allah (azwj) has Said: “[35:28] Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants, who have knowledge”. So do not seek anything from this world by being disobedient to Allah (azwj), and preoccupy yourselves in this world by obedience to Allah (azwj), and seize its days, in a way to ensure your salvation ‘Tomorrow’ from the Punishment of Allah (azwj). That is the smallest consequence and the lowest form of excuse and the hope for the salvation. So give priority to the Commands of Allah (azwj) and the obedience to the one (asws) whose obedience Allah (azwj) has Made it to be more than obligatory in all the matters in front of you. Do not give priority to the commands, which come to you from being obedient to the tyrants about the attractions of this world as oppose to that of Allah (azwj) but rather submit to Him (azwj), and to the Masters of the Command (asws) (Ul Al-Amr) from among you. And know that you are all servants of Allah (azwj) and we (asws) are with you. There is a Ruler (azwj) Who will Rule over us (asws) and you tomorrow, who is the Chief of the rulers. And He (azwj) will Make you to pause and Question you, so prepare the answer before the pausing and the Questioning and presentation to the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds on the Day in which no soul shall speak except by His (azwj) Permission. And know that Allah (azwj), on that Day, will neither Ratify a liar nor will He (azwj) Belie a truthful one, nor will He (azwj) Reject the excuse of a deserving one, nor Excuse the one who has no justification, as He (azwj) has the Proof over His (azwj) creatures by the Messengers (as) and the successors (as) of the Messengers (sa). So fear Allah (azwj), servants of Allah (azwj), and welcome the correctors to yourselves, and the obedience to Allah (azwj) and the obedience to the ones (asws) whom Allah (azwj) has Made to be Guardians regarding it. Perhaps the remorseful ones may regret for having wasted their yesterday regarding the Side of Allah (azwj) (Junb Allah (azwj) i.e. Ali (asws)), and wasted the Rights of Allah (azwj). And seek Forgiveness from Allah (azwj) and repent to Him (azwj) for He (azwj) Accepts the repentance, and Forgives the sins and Knows what you are doing. And beware of the company of the disobedience ones, and the help of the unjust ones, and the compulsions of the mischievous ones. Be cautious of their strife and distance yourselves from their places. And know that the one who opposes the Guardians (asws) of Allah (azwj), and makes it to be a Religion without the Religion of Allah (azwj), and issues commands other than the commands of the Guardians (asws) of Allah (azwj) will be in the Inflamed Fire, which consumes the bodies from which its spirit is absent, and which have been overcome by its misfortune. (At preent) they are dead, not feeling the heat of the Fire, and had they been alive they would have found their suffering in the heat of the Fire. And take a lesson, O people of vision, and Praise Allah (azwj) for what He (azwj) has Guided you with, and know that you cannot escape from the Power of Allah (azwj) to another power. Allah (azwj) Sees your deeds, as well as His (azwj) Messenger, then to them will be your resurrection. So benefit from the advice, and educate yourselves with the discipline of the righteous.",

Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Ahmad All Kufy, and he is Al-A’asmiy, from Abdul Wahid Bin Al-Sawwaf, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Al-Hamdany who has narrated the following: Abu Al-Hassan Musa (asws) having said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) used to bequeath to his (asws) companions saying: ‘I (asws) bequeath you to fear Allah (azwj) for it is happiness for the truthful seeker, and a heavy shackle for the runaway fugitive. And be aware of the piety realising it within yourselves, and remember Allah (azwj) with a sincere Remembrance, being revived by it, and journey upon the path of salvation. Look at this world with the vision of the ascetics, the ones who have parted from it, for it dislodges its residents and causes distress to the affluent ones who (superficially) feel safe. Do not hope for those that are turned away from it, not knowing what it is that will come from it. So await patiently for the prosperity upon the arrival of the afflictions from it, and the survival from it up to the end. So its happiness is tainted with the grief, and the survival in it is up to the weakness and the fragility. So it is like a garden, the pasture of which is dense causing those who look at it, to wonder at it. Its drinks are sweet, its covering (soil) is good, its roots are excited in the ground, and its branches drip moisture until the grass reaches its due level. The scent gets triggered under the blades and gets separated from it in the morning, just as Allah (azwj) has Said: “[18:45] then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter; and Allah is the holder of power over all things.” Look at this world and the numerous things which cause you to wonder, and the scarcity of the things which benefit you’.",

Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ma’mar, from Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ukaayat Al-Tamimy, from Al-Husayn Bin Al-Nazar Al-Fahry, from Abu Amro Al-Awzaiy, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Jabir Bin Yazeed who said: ‘I came up to Abu Ja’far (asws), so I said, ‘O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), the differing among the Shiites in this Doctrine causes me pain’. He (asws) said: ‘O Jabir, shall I (asws) not suffice you with the meanings of their differences, from where they are differing, and from which perspective they are separating?’ I said, ‘Yes, O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj)’. He (asws) said: ‘So do not differ if they differ, O Jabir. The one who fights against the Master (asws) of the Era (Imam (asws) of his time) is like the one who has fought against the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) in his (saww) days. O Jabir, listen attentively’. I said, ‘As you (asws) like’. He (asws) said: ‘Listen attentively, and make it reach to wherever your ride takes you, that Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) preached to the People at Al-Medina, seven days after the passing away of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and that was when he (asws) was free from collecting the Quran and compiling it. He (asws) said: ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj) Who has Prevented the imaginations to grasp Him (azwj) except for His (azwj) Existence, and Veiled the intellects to think about His (azwj) Essence due to the restrictions of Him (azwj) having no similarities or images. But He (azwj) is the One in Whose Essence there are not differences nor any division into a number of parts due to the Perfection. He (azwj) is separate from the things, not due to being in a different place, and He (azwj) is in things, not being mixed within them, and He (azwj) Knows these, not by the use of tools. And He (azwj) is not Knowledgeable except by it, and there is nothing between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) Knowledge, any other knowledge. He (azwj) is the Knowledgeable by Himself (azwj). If it is said that He (azwj) was, it would be interpreted as the eternal existence, and if it is said that He (azwj) will never cease (to exist), it would be interpreted as the negation of the non-existence. He (azwj) is Glorious, and higher than the words of those who worship other than Him (azwj) and have taken a god other than Him (azwj). He (azwj) is Higher and Greater. We (asws) Praise Him (azwj) with a Praise of those of His (azwj) creatures who has Pleased Him (azwj), and He (azwj) has Made it to be more than Obligatory upon Himself (azwj) to Accept it. And I (asws) hereby testify that there is no God but Allah (azwj), One, with no Associates for Himself (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant and His (azwj) Messenger. These two testimonies elevate the words and increase the deeds. Light is the Scale from which these two are raised from, and heavy is the Scale on which these two are placed. And by these two is the victory of the Paradise, and the salvation from the Fire, and the Permission upon the (crossing of) the Bridge. And it is by the testimony that you will be entering the Paradise, and by the Prayers that you will be consuming the Mercy. Send the greetings frequently upon your Prophet (saww) “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. O you people! There is no nobility higher than Al-Islam, nor a prestige more honourable than the piety, nor a stronghold better than devoutness, nor an intercessor more excellent than repentance, nor a robe more majestic than good health, nor a protection more secure than safety, nor a wealth better at dispelling poverty than contentment with conviction/cetainity, nor a treasure more enriching than being satisfied. And the one lives at the subsistence level and the reduction in comfort, so he has made the preparations for the rest, and the desires is the key to the fatigue, and the monopolisation follows from affliction, and the jealousy is a scourge on the Religion, and the greed is an invitation to the indulgence in the sins and the reason for the deprivation, and the transgression is a driver to the destruction, and greed gathers all the defects. Perhaps a failed greed, a false hope leads to the dispossession and a business trade to incur a loss. The one who gets involved in the matters without looking at the consequences will be exposed to misfortunes, and the most evil of the collars (humiliation) for a Believer is the sin. O you people! There is no treasure more beneficial than the knowledge, and no honour higher than the forbearance, and no nobility more eloquent than the ethics, and no affliction greater than anger, and no majesty more decorative than the intellect, and nothing is more disgraceful than the lies, and no protection safer than silence, and no absentee which is nearer than the death. O you people! The one who looks at his own faults will be too pre-occupied to look at the faults of the others, and the one who is contented with the sustenance of Allah (azwj) will not despair upon what is in the hands of the others, and the one who unsheathes the sword of rebellion will be killed by it, and the one who drills a pit for his brother will fall into it himself, and the one who discloses the veiled (privacy) of others will uncover the privacy of his own house, and the one who forgets his own mistakes will magnify the mistakes of the others, and the one who wonders at his own opinion will go astray, and the one who considers himself to be needless due to his intellect will make mistakes, and the one who is arrogant to the people will be humiliated, and the one who is a fool to the people will be hated, and the one who mixes with the villains will be degraded, and the one who burdens himself with what he cannot endure will be frustrated. O you people! There is no wealth more valuable than the intellect, and no poverty which is more intense than the ignorance, and no preacher which is more profound than the sound advice, and no reasoning like the contemplation, and no worship like the pondering, and no demonstration more reliable than the consultation, and no isolation more severe than the self-conceit, nor piety like refraining from the Prohibitions, and no forbearance like patience and silence. O you people! In the human being there are ten qualities, which are revealed by his tongue and becomes witness to his hidden thoughts, it is a ruler by which he decides between what to be said, and the words by which he returns the answer, and an intercessor (limbs) by which he achieves the needs, and a describer (senses) by which he recognises the things, and a commander (decision) by which he commands for the good, and a preacher by which he prohibits from the ugly (deeds), and a consoler by which he gives solace to the sorrows, and a conscious by which he clears the malice, and an articulator by which he gives pleasure to the ears. O you people! There is no good in keeping silent about the ‘الْحُكْمِ’ (the Command) just as there is no good in speaking out of ignorance. And know, O you people, that the one who does not control his tongue will regret, and the one who does not learn will be ignorant, and the one who does not forbear will not content, and the one who is not deterred does not learn, and the one who does not know is insulted, and the one who is insulted is not respected, and the one who is not respected is taunted, and the one who acquires wealth from where he has no right to do so will spend it extravagantly in other that the right way, and the one who does not desist when he is praised will desist when he is condemned, and the one who does not give in comfort will also be refused when in the need, and the one who seeks the honour without being deserving of it will be disgraced, the one who overcomes with injustice will also be overpowered, and the one who opposed the truth will necessitate weakness for himself, and the one who ponders will be dignified, and the one who is arrogant will be belittled, and the one who is not good will not be praised. O you people! The death is (better) before the lowliness, and the endurance before the apathy, and the accounting before the Punishment, and the grave is better than the poverty, lowering the sight is better than looking at a great deal, and the time, a day is for you and a day against you. So if it is for you, do not be ungrateful, and if it is against you, observe patience. So with both of them you will be Examined. (And in another copy – ‘And with both of them you will be Tested’) O you people! The strangest of what is in the human being is his heart, and in it are matters of wisdom and the antibodies to the one who opposes it. When there is prosperity for him, greed humiliates him, and if greed excites him, the thriftiness destroys him, when despair overpowers him, the remorse kills him, and when the anger presents itself, the rage intensifies, and when he is happy and satisfied he forgets to conserve, and when fear seizes him he gets preoccupied by caution, and when security is widened for him his honour makes him complacent (and in another copy ‘pride takes him over’), and when new bounties come up for him pride takes him over, and when he is benefitted by money his richness makes him oppressive, and when poverty bites him he is preoccupied by the affliction (and in another copy ‘he strives in the weeping’), and when he is inflicted by hardship anxiety injures him, and when the hunger exhausts him he is disabled by the weakness, and when he over-eats he is upset by indigestion, so every deficiency is harmful to him, and every excess spoils him. O you people! The one who is miserly will be disgraced and the one who is generous will be the master, and the one who increases his wealth becomes the leader and the one who increases his forbearance becomes noble, and the one who ponders regarding the Essence of Allah (azwj) becomes an Atheist, and the one who frequents in something becomes known for it, and the one frequently jokes will be taken lightly, and the one who frequently laughs his prestige goes away, the one who has no ethics will corrupt. The best deed is the maintenance of honour by wealth. There is none who sits with the ignorant ones who is reasonable, for the one who sits with the ignorant ones should ready himself for (a lot of) talk (against him)’. And he (asws) said: ‘Neither did the rich one obtain salvation from death by his wealth, nor did the poor one due to his scarcity’. O you people! Had the death been (a commodity) which could be bought, the good and the honourable ones of the world, as well as the wicked and the greedy ones would have bought it. O you people! There are witnesses for the hearts which hold them back from being the people of excesses, and there is insight for the understanding, which alerts the self and caution it from the danger. And for the heart there are memories of desires, and the intellect admonishes and prohibits from it. And in the experiences there is an appellant, which is a reliable guide to the right way. It is sufficient for yourself what you would not like it to happen to others, and it is upon you that the same should be for your believing brother, and in it upon him, likewise. The one who considers his own opinion to be self-sufficing from him would endanger him, and the pondering before the deeds would keep you safe from remorse. And the one who welcomes different opinions would understand the places of mistakes. And the one who refrains from the useless matters his opinion would balance the intellects. The one who fortifies his carnal desires so he has kept his respect, and the one who restrains his tongue is trusted by the people and will achieve his needs. And in the alteration of the situations the jewels of the men become known, and the passing days make apparent the inner selves. And there is no enjoyment in the swiftness of lightning for the one who goes through darkness. And the one who is recognised by the wisdom, the eyes will notice him with reverence and prestige. The most noble of riches is the avoidance of wishes, and the patience is a shield against poverty, and the greed is a sign of poverty, and the stinginess is the gown of destitution, and the cordiality with the relatives is beneficial, and the sympathy of the poor is better than the disloyal rich. Counselling is like a cave for the one who listens to it, and the one who does not restrain his eyes, his regrets increase. And the (passage of) time has made it to be more than obligatory for the one who avails it, to thank it. The tongue does very little justice in displaying the ugly and the good. The one who constricts his ethics, his family get tired of him. And the one who seeks, achieves it for a long time, and very little of what is wished is sincere. Modesty clothes you with dignity, and in the extensiveness of the morals is a treasure for the sustenance, and how many from the people remain in their sins until the end of their days. And the one who robes himself with bashfulness as his clothing his faults are hidden from the people. And intend moderation in your speech, for the one who intends it will incur light expenses, and in the opposition to the ego is guidance for you. And the one who recognises the ‘days’ (his end) will never be oblivious from the preparation. Nay! Along with every sip (of drink) is (possibility of) choking, and in every morsel is (the possibility of) suffocation. Bounties cannot be achieved except by the decline of other (bounties), and for every breath is life, and for every grain is a consumer, and you are the morsel of the death. And know, O you people! The ones who walks upon the face of the earth will end up in its belly, and the nights and the days, they dispute (they accelerate) regarding the destruction of the life-span. O you people! Ingratitude for the bounties is wickedness, and the company of the ignorant is ominous. The softness of the speech is from the prestige. And from the (acts of) worship are displayed by the tongue (make it heard) and increase the greetings. Beware of deceit for it is from the manners of the villains. Every seeker does not get a share, nor does every absentee return. Its not certain that one will get what he wishes and the lost is recovered. Seek (the company) of friends before setting of and ensure (good) neighbourhood before (moving into) the house. Indeed! The one who moves fast will catche up with the slower ones. Conceal the private (matters) of your brother just as he knows regarding you. Forgive the mistakes of your friend for the day that your enemy comes to dominate you. The one who is angry with the one over whom he has no power to injure, his grief would be prolonged and it will punish his soul. The one who fears his Lord (azwj) will refrain from committing injustices. The one who is good with the words would display his pride. And the one who does not recognise the good from the evil, is like an animal. Indeed the corruption destroys the provisions (of the Hereafter). How little is the difficulty (of today) as compared with the great destitution tomorrow. Far it is! Far it is from being compared. And what is your antipathy due to, except for your indulgence in acts of disobedience and the sins. So how close is the rest to the tiredness, and the misery from the Bounties. The hardships are not painful after which there is the Paradise, and the goodtime is not the (lasting) comfort after which there is the Fire. And every bounty apart from the Paradise is insignificant, and every affliction apart from the Fire is healthy. And turning away from correcting the consciences leads to the major sins. Purification of the deeds is more difficult than the deed itself, and the sincerity of the intention from the corruption is more difficulty upon the performer of the deed than the lengthy Jihaad. Far it is! Had it not been for the piety I (asws) would have been the shrewdest of the Arabs. O you people! Allah (azwj) the High Promised His (azwj) Prophet (saww) Muhammad (saww) the Means (Al-Waseela), and His (azwj) Promise is True, and Allah (azwj) does not Go against His (azwj) Promise. Surely Al-Waseela is on the steps of the Paradise and is at the peak of the nearness (to Allah (azwj)), and is a total security at the very end of it. There are a thousand staircases, and what is in between one staircase and the other there is a travel distance by a fine horse of a hundred years. And in between these is a staircase of gems going up to a staircase of jewels, to a staircase of aquamarines, to a staircase of pearls, to a staircase of rubies, to a staircase of emeralds, to a staircase of corals, to a staircase of camphor, to a staircase of ambergris, to a staircase of aloe, to a staircase of gold, to a staircase of clouds, to a staircase of air, to a staircase of Light which encompasses all of the Gardens. And on that Day the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) would be seated wearing two Garments – a Garment of the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and a Garment of the Light of Allah (azwj). On him (saww) will be a Crown of the Prophet-hood and a Garland of the Message, the Light of which will illuminate the whole of the Pausing Place (Station in the Hereafter). And on that Day, I (asws) will be upon the High Level, and it will be lower than his (saww) Level, and on me (asws) would be two Garments – a Garment of purple Light and a Garment of Camphor. And the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (saww) would have paused upon my (asws) staircase, with the Flags of the Eras and the Proof of the ages on our (asws) right, and they (as) will have Majestic Garments of Light and the Prestige. There is no Angel of Proximity, and no Messenger Prophet (saww) who will look at us (asws) except that he will be stunned by our (asws) Light. And stranger than our (asws) Illumination and our (asws) Majesty is the Al-Waseela on our (asws) right, and on the right of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a cloud stretching out as far as the eye can see. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the Prophet (saww), the ‘Ummy’ of the Arabs. And the one who disbelieved, so the Fire is Prepared for him. And on the left of Al-Waseela, from the left of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) will be a shade. A Call will come out from it: ‘O people of the Pausing Place! Goodness is for the ones who loved the successor (asws) and believed in the ‘Ummy’ Prophet (saww), the one (saww) for whom is the High Kingdom. There is no success for anyone, nor happiness for the soul, and the Paradise except for the one who is meeting his Creator (azwj) with the sincerity for these two (asws) and the follower of the stars (Imams (asws)) from these two (asws). Be convinced, O people of Al-Wilayah of Allah (azwj), of the whitening of your faces, and the prestige of your seating, and the honour of your return and your success today, with bliss, facing each other. And O people of the deviation, and the diverters from Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance, and from His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and from His (azwj) Path, and the Flags of the eras, be convinced of the blackening of your faces, and the Wrath of your Lord (azwj), a Recompense of what you used to do before. And there is none from the Messengers (as) who preceded and none from the Prophets (as) of the past except that he (as) had informed his (as) community of the Messenger (saww) to come after him (as), and the good news of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and bequeathed to his (as) community, and described him (saww) to his (as) community his (saww) qualities, and that they should follow him (saww) and be upon his (saww) Law, so that they would not stray with regards to him (saww) after him (as). So the ones who would face destruction and straying afterwards would only be after the occurrence of the reasons and the warnings, and having been acquainted with the evidence, and the arguments having been established. So the communities lived in hope about the Messengers (as) and the Prophets (as) to come, if they were in difficult circumstances in the absence of a Prophet (as) after their Prophet (as), in their great difficulties and disasters, so they were at the time in a state of hope. And there have never been a difficulty which was greater, and nor a disaster greater like the difficulties with the Messenger of Allah (saww), because Allah (azwj) Ended the Warnings, and the Reasons, and Cut-off through him (saww) the Arguments, and the Reasons between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) creatures, and Made him (saww) to be His (azwj) Door which was between Him (azwj) and His (azwj) servants, and as His (azwj) Authority which nothing would be Acceptable except by him (saww), nor any nearness to Him (azwj) except by being obedient to him (saww). And He (azwj) Said Decisively in His (azwj) Book: “[4:80] Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah and whoever turns back, so We have not sent you as a keeper over them”. So He (azwj) Joined obedience to Himself (azwj) with obedience to him (saww), and disobedience to Himself (azwj) with disobedience to him (saww). So that was the Evidence which was Delegated to him (saww), and a Testimony against the one who obeys him (saww), and disobeys him (saww), and between that in other places from the Great Book. So the Blessed and the High Said in the Incitement to follow him (saww), and the Exhortation with regards to his (saww) ratification, and the acceptance of his (saww) Call: “[3:31] Say, (O Muhammad, tell to mankind): If you love Allah, follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins”. So following him (saww) achieves the Love of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Pleasure, and the Forgiveness of the sins, and the completeness of the success, and the necessitation of the Paradise. And in the turning away from him (saww) achieves the Enmity of Allah (azwj), and His (azwj) Wrath, and His (azwj) Harshness, and remoteness from Him (azwj), and a dwelling in the Fire and that is His (azwj) Statement: “[11:17] and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, the Fire will be their promised meeting-place”, meaning the striving against him (saww) and disobedience to him (saww). Allah (azwj), Blessed is His (azwj) Name, Tested His (azwj) servants by me (asws), and killed those that opposed Him (azwj) by my (asws) hand, and annihilated those that strived against Him (azwj) by my (asws) sword, and Made me (asws) to be a Means of nearness to Him (azwj) (Zulfat) for the Believers, and a ground of death for the toughest tyrants, and His (azwj) Sword against the criminals, and Strengthened by me (asws) the back of His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and Honoured me (asws) by helping him (saww), and Privileged me (asws) with his (saww) knowledge, and Gifted me (asws) with his (saww) Laws, and Favoured me (asws) for his (saww) successorship, and Chose me (asws) for his (saww) Caliphate in his (saww) community. So he (saww) said when he (saww) mobilised the Emigrants and the Helpers in their gathering: ‘O you people! Surely, Ali (asws) is from me (saww) like Haroun (as) was from Musa (as) except that there is no Prophet (as) to come after me (saww). So the Believers understood that the Messenger (saww) was speaking on behalf of Allah (azwj). They recognised me (asws) that I (asws) was not his (saww) brother by his (saww) father (as) or his (saww) mother (as) as was the case with Haroun (saww) who was the brother of Musa (as) from his (as) father and his (as) mother (as), nor was I (asws) a Prophet (as). The Prophet-hood has ended. But, that was from him (saww) appointing me (asws) as the Caliph just as Musa (as) had appointed Haroun (as) as the Caliph when he (as) said: “[7:142] Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.” And his (saww) words when a group spoke saying, ‘We are the friends of the Messenger of Allah (azwj)’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) went out to the Farewell Pilgrimage, then came up to Ghadeer Khumm. So he (saww) ordered for something resembling a Pulpit to be prepared to him (saww). Then he (saww) ascended it, grabbed my (asws) arm and raised it to the extent that the whiteness of his (saww) armpits were seen, and said in a raised voice in that forum: ‘The one to whom I (saww) was the Master of, so Ali (asws) is his Master. Our Allah (azwj)! Befriend the one who befriends him (asws), and be Inimical to the one who is an enemy to him (asws). Thus, upon my (asws) Wilayah is the Wilayah of Allah (azwj), and upon my (asws) enmity is the enmity against Allah (azwj). And Allah (azwj), Mighty and Majestic Revealed in that day: “[5:3] This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion”. So upon my (asws) Wilayah was the completion of the Religion, and the Pleasure of the Lord (azwj), Majestic is His (azwj) Remembrance. And Allah (azwj), Blessed and High, Revealed it especially for me (asws) and Honoured the Gifting it for me (asws) as (a sign of) greatness, and its gifting from the Messenger of Allah (saww), and it is the Statement of the High: “[6:62] Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the (only) reality: Is not His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account.” If I (asws) were to mention my (asws) merits, its loftiness would be great, and it’s listening prolonged. And about me (asws), two miserable ones before me (asws) disputed with me (asws) regarding that in which they had no rights over it, and they rode its misguidance, and believed in the ignorance. So evil is what was to them, what they returned to, and evil is what they made as a cradle for themselves. They cursed each other in their own houses, and each one of them distanced himself from his companion saying to him when he met him, ‘Alas! If only there was the distance between the East and the West between me and between you’. So evil is the friend who answered him, the miserable one upon his ragged condition, “[25:28] O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend. [25:29] He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever man’s deserter in the hour of need”. So I (asws) am the Reminder from which he went astray, and the Way from which he deviated, and the Belief which he denied, and the Quran from which he fled, and the Religion which he belied, and the Path from which he digressed. And the debris which they lived upon in their constant pride, they were on it on the verge of the Fire (prepared) for them - an evil return amongst the wicked group, to a condemned destination. They will be shouting curses at each other grumbling in regret. There will be no rest for these two; nor a respite from their inevitable Punishment. The people never ceased to be the worshippers of the idols and being the custodians of the idols, establishing rituals for them, and designated certain offerings for them in order to seek nearness to them. And they made for them titles such as ‘Al-Baheyra, and Al-Waseyla, and Al-Sa’ebat, and Al-Haam’. They distributed these idols by casting lots by arrows, wondering about Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance. They were confused about the guidance, hastening to the remoteness, and they had been overcome by Satan (la) who had flooded them with the darkness of ignorance, having breastfed them with ignorance and weaned them with misguidance. Allah (azwj) Brought us (asws) out to them as a Mercy, and Informed about us (asws) as being higher than them, and Removed the Veil of Light from us (asws) for those that sought us (asws), and Preferred the ones who followed it (the Light), and we (asws) were a support for the ones who ratified it. So honour followed after the disgrace, and the plenty after the scarcity. And their hearts and their eyes revered them, and the tyrants yielded to them, and its respective communities became the people of the Bounties, being worthy of mention, and prestigious, and ease, and security after fear, and ‘جَمْعٍ’ union after having been separated. And Ma’d Bin Adnan was illuminated (famous) due to us (asws) and we (asws) inserted them in the Door of Guidance, and we (asws) entered them into the House of Peace, and we (asws) clothed them with the garment of Belief, and they became famous due to us (asws) in the worlds, and the effects of the righteous people appeared for them in the days of the Messenger (saww), from a striving protector, and an obedient worshipper, and an ascetic retreater, and they preserved the trusts and became as such until when Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Called back His (azwj) Prophet (saww) and Raised him (saww) to Himself (azwj). That was not after him (saww) except like a moment of pulse, or a glimmer of lightning for them to return back and turn back upon their heels, and sought revenge by forming battalions, and they blocked the Door and destroyed the houses, and changed the effects of the Messenger of Allah (saww), and turned away from his (saww) rulings, and distanced themselves from his (saww) Light, and they changed his (saww) Caliph with an alternate. They took to him, and they were unjust in doing so, and they thought that the one whom they had chosen from the descendants of Abu Kohafa (Abu Bakr) is higher in status than the one (asws) whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had chosen to be in his (saww) place, and that the Emigrants from the progeny of Abu Kohafa were better than the Emigrants and the Helpers of the Rabbi of the Law Hashim Bin Abd Manaf (as). Nay! The first false testimony which occurred in Al-Islam was their testimony that their companion (Abu Bakr) is the one whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had made to be the Caliph. So when the matter of Sa’d Bin Ubada was what it was, they retracted from that and said that the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) passed away and did not appoint a Caliph. So the Messenger of Allah (saww), the good, the Blessed, was the first one in Al-Islam against who the false testimony was borne. And after a little while they found out the evil of what (they came to know and found out the consequences of the evil of what) the former ones had established. And they had an alternative and an opportunity to recover from the death, and had the time to turn around from the lure of pride, and be in a tranquil condition, and the realisation of the deeds. Allah (azwj) had respited Shaddaad Bin Aad, and Thamud Bin Abbuwad, and Bal’am Bin Ba’our, and Bestowed upon them His (azwj) Favours, both apparent as well as hidden, Supplied them with the wealth, and the (prolongation) of their lives, and Granted them the land, so that due to these Blessings they would Remember the Signs of Allah (azwj), and they would recognise and be awed by Him (azwj), and turn to Him (azwj), and bring an end to their arrogance. So before they reached their (allocated) time, and enjoy their meal, Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Grabbed them and cut them down. Some of them from sandstorm, some were overtaken by a scream, and some from being burned by the shadow, and some from the tremors, and some from sinking of the earth. Allah (azwj) was not Unjust to them, but they had been unjust to their own selves. Indeed! For every term there is a writing. So when the writing reaches its term, and it is uncovered for you about what would befall the unjust ones, and what the greatest losers have got to, you will run towards Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic from what they had been involved in and to what they are proceeding to. Nay! And I (asws) am among you, O you people, like Haroun (as) was in the people of the Pharaoh (la), and like the Door of Hitta in the Children of Israel, and like the Ark of Noah (as) in the people of Noah (as). I (asws) am the Great News (Al-Nabaa Al-Azeem), and the Great Truthful (Al-Siddique Al-Akbar), And after a little while you will come to know what had been Promised to you. And is this anything else but (was committed) for a morsel of food, and a sip of drink, light sleep. Then the disgrace will be necessitated upon them in the world, and on the Day of Judgement they will be returning to intense Punishment. And Allah (azwj) is not Oblivious (forgetful) of what they have done. So what is the Recompense for the one who turned away from His (azwj) Proof (asws), and denied His (azwj) Argument, and opposed His (azwj) Guides (asws), and turned away from His (azwj) Light and stormed (his way) into the darkness, and exchanged water for the mirage, and Bounties for the Punishment, and the success for the misery, and prosperity for the poverty, and the ease for the hardship. Nay! This is the Recompense of what they had sown and done before. So be certain of the Promise and of its reality, and be assured of what has been Promised on the Day of the coming of the ‘Scream’ (Dooms Day), with the Truth. “[50:42] The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth. [50:43] Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventuAl-coming [50:44] The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste; that is a gathering together easy to Us”.",

        "englishText": "5. Muhammad Bin Ali Bin Ma’mar, from Muhammad Bin Ali, from Abdullah Bin Ayyub Al-Ash’ary, from Amro Al-Awza’iy, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Salma Biin Kuheyl, from Abu Al-Haysam Bin Al-Tayhaan who has narrated: Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon to the people at Al-Medina. Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) said: ‘All Praise is due to Allah (azwj) besides Whom (azwj) there is no god but Him (azwj). He (azwj) was Alive without (dependence on) any quality and without reliance on anything but on Himself (azwj) to exist nor can there be ‘where’ for Him (azwj), nor He (azwj) is within anything, nor He (azwj) is upon anything, nor there is a beginning place for Him (azwj), and He (azwj) is not strong after having Created a thing, nor was He (azwj) weak before anything came into being, nor was He (azwj) lonely before He (azwj) Began anything, nor is there anything which Resembles Him (azwj), nor was He (azwj) without a Kingdom before He (azwj) Created it, nor will He (azwj) be without it after it goes away. He (azwj) is a Living God without having a lifespan, and He (azwj) was the Owner before He (azwj) Created anything, and will be the Owner after having Creating the Universe. And there cannot be for Allah (azwj), ‘How’ nor ‘Where’, and no Limit to be Recognised by, and nothing resembles Him (azwj), and He (azwj) does not age due to the Duration of His (azwj) Remaining, nor does He (azwj) weaken due to being Alone, nor does He (azwj) get scared like His (azwj) creatures do due to something. But, He (azwj) is All Hearing without having ears, He (azwj) is All Seeing without having eyes, and He (azwj) is Almighty without deriving strength from His (azwj) creatures. The gaze of the lookers cannot perceive Him (azwj), and the ears of the listeners cannot sense (hear) Him (azwj). If He (azwj) Intends something, it would be without any consultation, or demonstration, or informing, or asking anyone about anything from His (azwj) creatures, of His (azwj) Intention. The vision cannot perceive Him (azwj), but He (azwj) Sees all visions. And He (azwj) is the Kind, the Aware, and I (asws) testify that there is no god except Allah (azwj), One, having no associates for Him (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant. He (azwj) Sent him (asws) with the Guidance, and the true Religion, to overcome all the religions even though the Polytheists may not like it. So he (saww) preached the Message, and I (asws) follow the evidence. O you community which has been deceived, and understood the deception of the deceiver who deceived it, but still persisted upon what it recognised, and wandered randomly in its seduction. And the truth had been clarified but they still turned away from it, and the path was made clear but they still deviated from it. But, by the One (azwj) Who Split the seed and stemmed life from it, had you sought the knowledge from its Mine, and drank the water with its sweetness, and kept the good in its place, and take the path which was clear, and approached the truth by its programme the way would have been set out for you, and the signs would have appeared to you, and Al-Islam would have been illuminated for you. So you would have eaten plentiful, and there would have been no breadwinner among you who would have failed (to earn), nor any injustice would have been done to any Muslim or allies. But, you walked upon the path of the darkness, so your world became dark for you by its vastness. And the doors of knowledge were closed to you so you spoke from your own desires, and differed in your Religion, and started issuing verdicts (Fatwas) in the Religion of Allah (azwj) without (being Blessed with the) Knowledge. And you followed the misguided people so they misguided you, and you abandoned the Imams (asws) so they (asws) abandoned you. So you took control (of your own affairs) through judging by your own desires. When a matter was mentioned, you asked the People (asws) of the Remembrance (Ahl Al-Zikr), so when they (asws) issued a verdict (Fatwa) to you, you said, ‘This is exactly the knowledge’. So how come you have abandoned him (asws), and neglected him (asws), and opposed him (asws)? Slowly (but surely), just wait a little while, and you will harvest all of what you have cultivated, and you will find the evil of what you have done and sought. By the One (azwj) Who Split the seed and stemmed life from it, you knew that I (asws) was your Master and the one (asws) whom you had been Commanded (for being obedient to), and I (asws) am more knowledgeable than you all and the one (asws) by whose knowledge was your salvation, and the successor (asws) of your Prophet (saww), and the best of your Lord (azwj), and the tongue (speaker) for your light (guidance), and the knowledge by which you can correct yourselves. So slowly (but surely) what has been narrated will descend upon you all, what has been promised, that which descended upon the communities before you. And Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Question you all about your Imams (asws) with whom (asws) you will be raised, and to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic you will be going to tomorrow. But, by Allah (azwj), if I (asws) had for me (asws), the number of companions which Talut had, or the number of the people at Badr who oppose your enemies, I (asws) would have struck by the sword until you would have come to the truth, and you would have repented sincerely. So that would have been more suitable than mending the rifts and taking to friendliness. Our Allah (azwj), Judge between us with the truth, and You (azwj) are the Best of the Judges’. He (the narrator) said, ‘Then he (asws) went out from the Masjid. He (asws) passed by a herd in which were around thirty sheep, so he (asws) said: ‘By Allah (azwj), if I (asws) had for me (asws) for the sake of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), the number of these sheep, I (asws) would have removed the son of the woman who ate unhealthy things, from his kingdom’. He (the narrator) said, ‘When it was evening, three hundred and sixty men had pledged allegiance to him (asws), to the death. So Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) said to them: ‘Come to us (in the morning) to the Ahjaar Al-Zayt having shaved (your heads)’. And Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) shaved (his (asws) head). No one from the people remained loyal, except for Abu Dharr (ar), and Al-Miqdad (ar), and Huzayfa Al-Yamani (ar), and Ammar Bin Yasser (ar), and Salman (ar). So he (asws) raised his (asws) hands towards the sky and said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! The people have weakened me (asws) just as the Children of Israel had weakened Haroun (as). Our Allah (azwj)! You (azwj) Know what we hide and what we proclaim, and there is nothing which is hidden from You (azwj) in the earth, nor in the sky. Make me to pass away as a Muslim, and Associate me (asws) with the righteous ones’. But, by the House (Kaaba), and the Leading up to the House (and in another copy, ‘Al-Muzdalifa’), and the walking to the throwing of the pebbles, had it not been for the oath which the Ummy Prophet (saww) had taken from me (asws), I (asws) would have returned the opposition to the gulf of the death, and I (asws) would have sent upon them thunderbolts of the death, and after a little while they will come to know’.",

        "englishText": "6. A number from our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, from Muhammad Bin Suleyman, from his father who said: ‘I was in the presence of Abu Abdullah (asws), when Abu Baseer came up to him (asws), and he was panting. So when he took his seat, Abu Abdullah (asws) said to him: ‘O Abu Muhammad, what is this heavy breathing for?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), great is my age, and my bones are creaking, and my term (death) is approaching, besides that I do not know what will happen to me from the matters of the Hereafter’. Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, and you are saying this?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), and how can I not say this?’ He (saww) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, but do you know that Allah (azwj) the High has Honoured the young ones among you, and is Bashful towards the elderly?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you, so how has He (azwj) Honoured the young, and been Bashful towards the elderly?’ He (asws) said: ‘Allah (azwj) has Honoured the young ones (too much) to Punish them, and is too Bashful towards the elderly to bring them to the Reckoning’. He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), is this especially for us, or for (all) the people of Tawheed (Believe in the Unity of Allah (azwj))?’ He (asws) said: ‘No, by Allah (azwj), it is only for you (Shiites) especially, apart from the whole world’. He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), we are being named by a name which is breaking our backs, and killing our hearts, and our blood has been declared lawful to be shed in the Hadeeth which are being narrated to them from their scholars’. Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘Is it ‘Al-Rafiza’ (the rejectors)?’ He said, ‘Yes’. He (asws) said: ‘No, by Allah (azwj), they are not the ones who have named you as such, but it is Allah (azwj) Who has Named you all with it’. But, do you know, O Abu Muhammad that seventy men from the Children of Israel rejected the Pharaoh (la) and his people, when they detected his misguidance. So they attached themselves with Musa (as) when they detected his (as) guidance. So they were named (referred to) in the army of Musa (as) as Al-Rafiza (The Rejectors) because they had rejected the Pharaoh (la), and they were the most intense worshippers in that army, and very intense in their love for Musa (as) and Haroun (as) and their (as) offspring. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Revealed unto Musa (as) that: “Establish this name for them in the Torah, for I (azwj) has Named them with it, and have Gifted it to them”. So Musa (as) established the name for them, then Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Reserved this name for you all to the extent that we (asws) have gifted it to you. O Abu Muhammad, they rejected the good, and you have rejected the evil. All the people have separated into sects, and they all divided into branches. You have branched out with the People (asws) of the Household of your Prophet (saww), and you did what they did, and you chose what Allah (azwj) had Chosen for you, and you wanted what Allah (azwj) wanted. So received glad tidings upon glad tidings, for By Allah (azwj), you (Shiites) are ones with whom Allah (azwj) has been Merciful, the ones whose good deeds will be Accepted, and the sins being Overlooked. The one who does not come to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, with what you are upon, on the Day of Judgement, the good deeds will not be Accepted from him, nor will his sins be Overlooked. O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Assigned Angels to cut-off the sins from the backs of our (asws) Shiites just like the leaves get cut-off in the autumn by the wind, and that is His (azwj) Statement, the Mighty and Majestic: “[40:7] Those who bear the Throne and those around Him celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask protection for those who believe”. By Allah (azwj), their Seeking of Forgiveness is for you (Shiites) apart from the other creatures. O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) has Mentioned you (Shiites) in His (azwj) Book. He (azwj) said: “[33:23] Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah: so of them is he who accomplished his vow, and of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least” You all have been loyal to the Covenant which Allah (azwj) has Taken from you, of our (asws) Wilayah, and you never exchanged us (asws) for others. Had you not done that, Allah (azwj) would have Reproached you just as He (azwj) Reproached them where He (azwj), Majestic is His (azwj) Remembrance, Said: “[7:102] And We did not find in most of them any (faithfulness to) covenant, and We found most of them to be certainly transgressors”. O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) has Mentioned you in His (azwj) Book: “[15:47] (they shall be) as brethren, on raised couches, face to face”. And Allah (azwj) has not Intended by this other than you (Shiites), O Abu Muhammad. So, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws): ‘O Abu Muhammad, “[43:67] The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another, except those who guard (against evil)”, and Allah (azwj) has not Intended by this other than you (Shiites). O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Mentioned us (asws) and our (asws) Shiites, and our (asws) enemies in a Verse from His (azwj) Book. The Mighty and Majestic Said: “[39:9] Are those who know equal with those who know not? But only men of understanding will pay heed”. So we (asws) are the ones who know, and our (asws) enemies are the ones who do not know, and our (asws) Shiites are the men of understanding. O Abu Muhammad, so have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you, increase it for me’. So he (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, By Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) has not Made an Exception for anyone from the successors (as) of the Prophets (as) and their (as) followers except for Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) and his (asws) Shiites. So He (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Book, and His (azwj) Words are True: “[44:41] The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend aught, nor shall they be helped, [44:42] Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful” Meaning by that Ali (asws) and his (asws) Shiites. O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) the High has Mentioned you all when He (azwj) Said: “[39:53] Say: O my servants! who have acted extravagantly against their own souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah forgives the faults altogether; surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful”. And Allah (azwj) has not Intended by this other than you (Shiites). So, have I (asws) made you happy, O Abu Muhammad’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. So he (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) has Mentioned you all in His (azwj) Book: “[17:65] Surely (as for) My servants, you have no authority over them; and your Lord is sufficient as a Protector”. And Allah (azwj) has not Intended by this but the Imams (asws) and their (asws) Shiites. So, have I (asws) made you happy, O Abu Muhammad?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. So he (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) has Mentioned you all in His (azwj) Book. He (azwj) Said: “[4:69] these are with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous, and a goodly company are they!” So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) in the Verse is ‘from among the Prophets (as)’, and we (asws), in this subject are the ‘truthful and the martyrs’, and you all are the ‘righteous’, therefore adopt this name by the righteousness as Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Named you. O Abu Muhammad, so, have I made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, Allah (azwj) has Mentioned you all when He (azwj) Narrated about your enemies in the Fire by His (azwj) Statement: “[38:62] And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious? [38:63] Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from them?” And Allah (azwj) has not Meant, and not Intended by this other than you (Shiites). You have become as the evil people in the eyes of this world, and by Allah (azwj), you will be in the Paradise you will be in delight whereas in the Fire you will be sought. O Abu Muhammad, so have I (asws) made you happy?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. He (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, there is none from the Verses Revealed Which Guides to the Paradise, nor Mentions it addressees with goodness except that it is regarding us (asws) and regarding our (asws) Shiites. And there is none from the Verses Revealed Which Mentions its addressees with evil, or Points to the Fire except that it is regarding our (asws) enemies and the ones who are opposed to us (asws). So, have I (asws) made you happy, O Abu Muhammad?’ He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), increase it for me’. So he (asws) said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, There is no one upon the Nation of Ibrahim (as) except for us (asws), and our (asws) Shiites, whereas the rest of the people are remote from that. O Abu Muhammad, have I (asws) made you happy?’ And in another report, he (asws) said: ‘This is enough’.",

        "englishText": "7. Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from one of his companions, and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ibn Abu Umeyr altogether, from Muhammad Bin Abu Hamza, from Humran who said: ‘Abu Abdullah (asws) said, and those in his (asws) presence mention the bad condition of the Shiites in his (asws) presence – So he (asws) said: ‘I (asws) was walking with Abu Ja’far Al-Mansour, and he was in his procession, and he was upon a horse and in front him were horsemen and behind him were horsemen, and I (asws) was upon a mule by his side. He said to me, ‘O Abu Abdullah (asws), it is befitting for you (asws) to be happy with what Allah (azwj) has Given us from the strength and the victory for us, and the honour, and do not tell your people that you (asws) and the People (asws) of your (asws) Household are more deserving of this Command (Caliphate) than we are, lest you (asws) provoke us against you (asws) and them. He (asws) said, ‘I (asws) replied: ‘And the one who has related this to you from me (asws) has lied’. He said to me (asws), ‘Will you (asws) swear an oath on what you (asws) are saying?’ I (asws) said: ‘The people are magicians, meaning they would love to spoil me (asws) (my (asws) position) in front of you. So do not listen to them, for people are more in need of you than you are of us’. He said to me (asws), ‘Do you (asws) remember the day when I asked you (asws), ‘Is there a kingdom for us?’, and you (asws) said, ‘Yes, very lengthy and vast’, you will not cease to be in the time in your command and the space in your world until you will harm us (asws) by shedding sacred blood in a sacred Month, in a sacred city?’ So I (asws) understood that he has memorized the Hadeeth. So I (asws) said: ‘Perhaps Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Suffice for you, for I (asws) did not apply this especially for you, but rather this is a Hadeeth which I (asws) reported to you. Maybe it is for someone else from the people of your household who will govern that’. He was silent from me (asws). When I (asws) returned to my (asws) home, one of our (asws) friends came up. He said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws). By Allah (azwj), I saw you (asws) in the procession of Abu Ja’far (Al-Mansour) and you (asws) were upon a mule and he was upon a horse, and he was speaking to you like an overseer speaks to an underling. So I said to myself, ‘This is the Proof (asws) of Allah (azwj) upon the creatures and the Master (asws) of this command (Caliphate) who should be followed, and this other one is acting by compulsion, and he kills the children of the Prophets (as), and sheds the blood in the earth by what Allah (azwj) does not Like, and he is in his procession, and you (asws) are upon a mule’, so that entered a doubt in me to the extent that I feared for my Religion and myself’. He (asws) said: ‘I (asws) said: ‘Had you seen those who were around me (asws), and in front of me (asws), and behind me (asws), and on my (asws) right, and on my (asws) left from the Angels, you would have despised him and despised what he was indulging in’. He said, ‘Now my heart is tranquil’. Then he said, ‘Until when will these be ruling (us), or until when will we get rest from them (their injustices)?’ I (asws) said: ‘Do you not know that there is a time allocated for everything?’ He said, ‘Yes’. So I (asws) said: ‘Would it benefit you if you come to know that this command (Caliphate), when it goes, it would be quicker than the blink of an eye? If you come to know their condition in the Presence of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic and how it would be, you would have been intense in your hatred of them. And if you were to struggle, and the people of the earth were to struggle to include them in more severity than what they are already in from the sins, you would not be able to. So do not let Satan (la) excite you. The Honour is for Allah (azwj) and for His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and for the Believers, but the hypocrites do not know. Nay! The one who waits for our (asws) Command, and observes patient upon what he see from the sufferings and the fear, tomorrow he would be in our (asws) group.

        "englishText": "8. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Amro Bin Usman, from Ali Bin Isa, from an unbroken chain. He (asws) said: ‘ (Prophet) Musa (as) was whispering (Munajaat) to Allah (azwj) Blessed and High. He (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Whispering: ‘O Musa (as)! Do not have long hopes regarding the world. That would harden your (as) heart, and the hard-hearted one is remote from Me (azwj). O Musa (as)! Turn yourself (as) (to obedience) for the sake of My (azwj) Pleasure, for if My (azwj) Pleasure is obeyed, so I (azwj) am not disobeyed. Kill your heart with the fear and create new clothes for the heart. You (as) will be hidden from the people of the earth and be recognised by the people of the sky. Spread out the lamps in your house at night and plead before Me (azwj) with the pleading of the patient ones and wail to Me (azwj) from the great number of the sins like the wailing of the sinner who has fled from his enemies. And seek help for that from Me (azwj) for I (azwj) am the Best of the Helpers, and the best of the Supporters. O Musa (as)! I (azwj) am Allah (azwj) high above the servants, and the servants are below Me (azwj), and everyone is helpless before Me (azwj). Accuse yourself for having wronged yourself, and do not trust your (as) son upon your (as) Religion unless he becomes like you (as), loving the righteous ones. O Musa (as)! Wash and bathe and be near to My (azwj) righteous servants. O Musa (as)! Be their Imam in their Prayers, and their Imam in what they squabble about, and judge between them by what I (azwj) have Revealed unto you (as). I (azwj) have Sent it down as a clear and luminous Proof, and a Light Speaking by what had transpired regarding the former ones and what will be regarding the later ones. I (azwj) Bequeath to you (as), O Musa (as), a bequest of the compassionate, the kind-hearted son of the Pious Lady, Isa (as) son of Maryam (as), owner of the mule, and the hooded gown, and the oil and the olive, and the Prayer Niche. And from after him (saww), about the owner of the red camel, the food, and pure, the purified. His (saww) example in your (as) Book is that he (saww) is a Believer, dominant over all the Books, and that he (saww) is the bowing one, the prostrating one, a seeker, a Monk, his (saww) brothers will be the poor, and his (saww) helpers will be another people, and there will occur in his (saww) era hardships and earthquakes, killings, and shortages of the wealth. His (saww) name would be Ahmad (saww), Muhammad (saww), the trusted one from the remaining ones of the previous generations. He (saww) will believe in all the Books and ratify all the Messengers (as) and testify sincerely for all the Prophets (as). His (saww) community will be the ones under the Mercy, Blessed with what will remain in the Religion upon its reality. They will fulfill their Prayers at its prescribed times, as servants optionally do for their chiefs, acknowledge him (saww) and follow his (saww) path. So he (saww) is your (as) brother. O Musa (as)! He (saww) is the ‘Ummy’, and he (saww) is a truthful servant. Whatever he (saww) places his (saww) hand upon, it becomes a Blessing for him (saww) and a Blessing for it. That is how it was in My (saww) Knowledge and that is how I (azwj) Created him (saww) as. It is by him (saww) that I (azwj) will Open the Hour (Day of Judgement) and it is by his (saww) community I (azwj) shall Seal (Bring an end to) the keys of the world. So, order the unjust ones of the Children of Israel that they should learn his (saww) name, and not to abandon it, but they (surely) will do it. And to love him (saww) is a good deed to Me (azwj), for I (azwj) am with him (saww) and I (azwj) am from his (saww) group, and he (saww) is from My (azwj) Group, and their group shall overcome. So, I (azwj) have Completed My (azwj) Words and will Make his (saww) Religion to prevail over all the Religions, and I (azwj) will be worshipped in all places, and I (azwj) shall Reveal unto him (saww) the Quran as a Criterion, a healing for what is in the chests from the whisperings of Satan (la). So send greetings to him (saww), O son (as) of Imran (as), for I (azwj) Send Greetings to him (saww) and so do My (azwj) Angels. O Musa (as)! You (as) are My (azwj) servant and I (azwj) am your (azwj) God. Do not belittle the despicable, the poor, and do not envy the rich for a little thing. And become humble in My (azwj) Remembrance and in it’s (the Torah) Recitation ravenously by My (azwj) Mercy, and make Me (azwj) Hear the pleasance of the Torah in a humble voice, full of grief. Be at rest during My (azwj) Remembrance, and mention Me (azwj) to the ‘one’ who is assured to Me (azwj), and worship Me (azwj) and do not associate with Me (azwj) anything. And make haste to My (azwj) Pleasure, ‘إِنِّي أَنَا السَّيِّدُ الْكَبِيرُ’ for I (azwj) and the Great Master (azwj). I (azwj) Created you (as) from a seed of menial water from clay which I (azwj) Took out from a disgraceful mixture of dust. So it was a human being and I (azwj) carved it into a creature. So Blessed is My (azwj) ‘وَجْهِي’ (My Wali (as)), and Holy is My (azwj) Craft. There is nothing like Me (azwj) and I (azwj) am the Eternal Living One who will not Decline. O Musa (as)! When you supplicate to Me (azwj), be fearful, anxious and rub your (as) face in the dust to Me (azwj) and prostrate to Me (azwj) by the noble parts of your (as) body, and plead in front of Me (azwj) when standing, and whisper to Me (azwj) when you whisper with a humble heart anxiously, and revive My (azwj) Torah in the days of the life, and teach My (azwj) Praise to the ignorant ones, and remind them of My (azwj) Favours, and My (azwj) Bounties, and tell them not to persist in the transgression in which they are engulfed, for My (azwj) Hold is Painful and Intense. O Musa (as)! If I (azwj) Cut off your Rope from Me (azwj) you (as) will not (be able to) connect with the rope of others. So, worship Me (azwj), and stand in front of Me (azwj) like the standing of the lowly poor servant. Condemn yourself for it is the highest (most deserving) for condemnation, and do not empower the Children of Israel by My (azwj) Book, for it is sufficient advice for your (as) heart and an enlightenment, and it is the Speech of the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds, Majestic and High. O Musa (as)! Whenever you supplicate to Me (azwj) and refer to Me (azwj), I (azwj) shall Forgive you (as) what was from you (as). The sky Glorifies to Me (azwj) My (azwj) Majesty, and the Angels are fearful of Me (azwj) and anxious, and the earth Glorifies to Me (azwj) ravenously, and all of the creation Glorifies Me (azwj) in humbleness. Then it is on you to Pray. The Prayer has a place with Me (azwj) and for it has in My (azwj) Presence a firm Covenant and I (azwj) Attach to it what was from it. Zakat is a sacrifice in order to cleanse the wealth, and the food, for I (azwj) do not Accept except for the ‘الطَّيِّبَ’ pure, (unless the instructions of) My (azwj) ‘وَجْهِي’ (My Wali (as)) are sought. And I (azwj) Joined with that the maintenance of relations, for I (azwj) am Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful, and as for the relationships, I (azwj) Created it Preferentially from My (azwj) Mercy for the servants to sympathise (with each other) by it, and for it, in My (azwj) Presence is an authorization in the return of the Hereafter, and I (azwj) will Cut-off the one who cuts it off (from My (azwj) Wali (asws)), and Connect with the one who keeps the connection (with My (azwj) Wali (asws)). And that is how I (azwj) will Deal in My (azwj) Command. O Musa (as)! Be generous to the beggar when he comes to you (as) by beautiful words, or giving easily because he may have come to you from neither from the humans nor from the Jinn. The Angels of the Beneficent come to test you (as) to see how you (as) are in your (as) dealings in regard to what I (azwj) have Given to you (as), and how consoling you (as) are regarding what I (azwj) have Authorised you (as) with. And be humble to Me (azwj) with the beseeching, and wail to Me (azwj) by lamentations from the Book. And know that I (azwj) Call you with the Calling of the master to his slave to Make him reach to the honourable position, and that is from My (azwj) Grace to you (as) and to your (as) forefathers of the former ones. O Musa (as)! Do not forget Me (azwj) in every situation, and do not be happy due to the abundance of the wealth, because forgetting Me (azwj) hardens the hearts, and the abundance of the wealth brings the abundance of the sins. The earth is obedient, and the sky is obedient, and the oceans are obedient, whereas disobedient to Me (azwj) are the unfortunate ones of Humans and the Jinns (Al-Saqalayn). And I (azwj) am the Beneficent, the Merciful. I (azwj) am Beneficent in every era. I (azwj) Give hardship after ease, and ease after hardship, and kings after kings, whereas My (azwj) Kingdom is permanently based and will never cease. And there is not hidden from Me (azwj) anything in the earth, nor in the sky, and how can it be hidden from Me (azwj) and from Me (azwj) is its beginning, and how come you are not fearful regarding what is in My (azwj) possession, and to Me (azwj) you (as) will inevitably return. O Musa (as)! Make Me (azwj) to be your (as) Protector, and place in My (azwj) possession your treasure for the good deeds, and fear Me (azwj) and do not fear others. To Me (azwj) is the destination. O Musa (as)! Be merciful to the one who is lower than you among the creatures, and do not become jealous of the one who is above you (as), for the jealousy consumes the good deeds just like the fire consumes the firewood. O Musa (as)! The two sons of Adam (as) wanted to express humbleness at a stage so that they could win My (azwj) Grace and My (azwj) Mercy. So they offered offerings, and I (azwj) do not Accept except from the pious ones. So their affair was what you (as) know, so, after this, how can you (as) (select) a trustworthy companion, the brother and the vizier (but by Me (azwj))? O Musa (as)! Put aside the arrogance and leave the pride, and remember that you (as) will be dwelling in the grave, and that should prevent you (as) from the lustful desires. O Musa (as)! Hasten to the repentance, and delay the sins, and deliberate in your (as) staying in front of Me (azwj) during the Prayer, and do not place hope in others. Take Me (azwj) to be your (as) shield in the difficulties, and as a fortress in disastrous circumstances. O Musa (as)! How can a creature humble itself to Me (azwj) without being aware of My (azwj) Mercy, and how can one recognise My (azwj) Mercy without having observed it; and how can one (ever) observe it without having faith in it, and how can one believe in it without having any hope of being blessed from it; and how can one hope for being Blessed while being satisfied with the world, having taken refuge in it and relying on the support of the unjust ones. O Musa (as)! Compete for the good with the people of goodness because the good is like its name, and leave the evil for those who are fascinated by it. O Musa (as)! Keep your (as) tongue behind your (as) heart and you (as) will be safe, and Remember Me (azwj) abundantly during the night and the day and you will gain, and do not follow the sins (errors) but you (as) will regret, for the sins are scheduled for the Fire. O Musa (as)! Speak good to the people who have left the sins and be in their company, and take them as your (as) brother in your (as) absence, and strive along with them and let them strive with you (as). O Musa (as)! The death will inevitably come to you (as). So make provision of such provisions like the one who is certain that it would last him till (he reaches) his destination. O Musa (as)! What you (as) intend with by for My (azwj) Face ‘وَجْهِي’ (My Wali (as)), even a little (submission) is a lot, and what you (as) intend with by for other than Me (azwj), even a lot (of effort to please him) is little (worthless). And reform your (as) days which are in front of you (as), and to realize the day in front of you and prepare to benefit from it, as for you (as) will be Paused and Questioned. Take your (as) lesson from the (past) era and its people, for the span of the era is short, but its shortness can be availed (to earn rewards), since everything is destined for destruction. So act as if you (as) can see the Reward for your (as) deeds in order for it to be an inevitable greed for you (as) regarding the Hereafter, for whatever is remaining from the world is like what has passed from it, and every worker strives upon visions and examples. So return to yourself (as), O son (as) of Imran (as), perhaps you (as) will succeed tomorrow on the Day of Questioning, for that is where the wrong doers will lose out. O Musa (as)! Throw out your (as) hand in front of Me (azwj) like the act of the slave calling out to his master, for if you (as) were to do that, you (as) will be the recipient of Mercy for I (azwj) am the Most Generous of the Powerful ones. O Musa (as)! Ask Me (azwj) from My (azwj) Grace, and My (azwj) Mercy, for these two are in My (azwj) Hands, none other is their owner, and look when you (as) ask Me (azwj) how your (as) wish is with what is in My (azwj) Possession. For every worker is a Recompense, and the disbeliever will be Recompensed with what he strives for. O Musa (as)! Do not concern yourself (as) with the world and seclude from it, for it is not for you (as), and you (as) are not its owner, and it is a house for the unjust ones. However, the one who does good deeds in it, it is a good house for him. O Musa (as)! What I (azwj) have Commanded you (as) to, so listen and keep quiet at whatever you (as) see. Take the realities of the Torah to your (as) chest, and keep vigil by it in the hours of the night and the day, and do not let the sons of the world to make your (as) chest to be a nest like the nest of the birds. O Musa (as)! The sons of the world and its people are a trial for some of them to the others. So each one of them decorates what is regarding him, whereas the Believer is the one for whom the Hereafter is decorated. So he looks at it unabated, and its pleasures become a barrier for him in between him and the pleasures of life. So he idealises by the dawn like the act of the passenger driven by it to its destination, remaining bleak and sad in the evening. So good news would be for him, and the curtain is Lifted, what he will see would delight his eyes. O Musa (as)! The world is a seed. It is not of any benefit for the Believer, nor is it a penalty for the one who is sinful. So, a lengthy woe is for the one who sells the Reward of his return for a morsel, which does not remain and a sip, which does not continue. So be as I (azwj) have Commanded you (as) to be, and every Command of Mine (azwj) is Guidance. O Musa (as)! When you (as) see the richness coming to you (as), so say: ‘It is a sin which is hastening the punishment for me (as)’. And when you (as) see the poverty coming to you (as), so say: ‘Welcome to the sign of the righteous ones’. And do not become an unjust tyrant, and do not join up with the unjust ones. O Musa (as)! What is a lifetime and it is lengthy and its end is condemnable. And what goes away from you (as) does not adversely affect you (as) if you (as) were to praise its result. O Musa (as)! The Book has Screamed out to you (as) a loud Scream with what you (as) are headed for. So how can the eyes fall asleep upon this, or how can the people find pleasure in the life. Had it not been for the deliberately being oblivious, and the following of the misfortune and the following of the lustful desires, and from other than this, that the righteous are in grief. O Musa (as)! Order My (azwj) servants to supplicate to Me (azwj) in whatever situation they may be in after having accepted that I (azwj) am indeed the Most Merciful of the merciful ones, the Answerer to the restless, and Remover of the evil, and the Changer of the eras, and the Giver of comfort, Thankful for a little, and Rewarding a great deal, and Enricher of the poor, and I (azwj) am the Eternally Mighty and Powerful. So the one who comes to you (as) and joined up with you (as) from the sinful ones, so say: ‘Welcome to the courtyard of the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds’, and seek Forgiven for them, and be kind to them like one of other, and do not dominate them by what I (azwj) have Given to you (as) of the preference over them, and tell them to ask from Me (azwj) from (and) My (azwj) Grace, and My (azwj) Mercy, for no one else is the owner of these, and I (azwj) am of the Great Grace , Good to you. O Musa (as)! Be a cave for the erroneous, and sit with the restless, and a seeker of Forgiveness among the sinful ones. You (as) are from Me (azwj) at the status of the Pleasure, so supplicate to Me (azwj) with the pure heart, and the truthful tongue, and be as I (azwj) have Commanded you (as) to be. Be obedient to My (azwj) Command and do not dominate over My (azwj) servants by what is not begun from you (as). And come nearer to Me (azwj), for I (azwj) am very near to you (as), for I (azwj) will never Ask you (as) what injures you (as) by its weight nor to carry it (burden). But rather, I (azwj) Ask you (as) that you (as) should supplicate to Me (azwj) so I (azwj) will Answer you (as), and that Ask from Me (azwj) so I (azwj) shall Give it to you (as), and that to come near to Me (azwj) by what you (as) have taken from Me (azwj) of its interpretation, and to Me (azwj) is the completion of its Revelation. O Musa (as)! Look towards the earth, for very soon it shall be your (as) grave, and raise your (as) eyes towards the sky for it is above you (as) and in it are great Angels, and weep upon yourself (as) for as long as you (as) are in the world, and fear the perishable and the destruction, and do not be deceived by the adornments of the world and its flowers, and do not be pleased with the injustice, and do not become an unjust one for I (azwj) Hold the oppressor to Account until I (azwj) Get justice from him for the oppressed one. O Musa (as)! The good deeds are Rewarded tenfold but there is single punishment for a sin even one is so severe. Do not Associate (anyone) with Me (azwj), it is not Permissible for you that you (as) should Associate with Me (azwj). Come nearer and be steadfast, and supplicate like the supplication of the greedy one greedy for what is in My (azwj) Possession, and regretful over what he has sent by what his hands (had earned) before. Just as the blackness of the night obliterates the day, and similarly the sins obliterate the good deeds, and the darkness of the night comes over the whiteness of the day, and similarly the sins come over the outstanding sins and blacken them (further)’.",

Ali Bin Muhammad, from someone he has mentioned, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, and Humeyd Bin Zyad, from Al-Hassan Bin Muhammad Al-Kindy altogether, from Ahmad Bin Al-Hassan Al-Maysami, from a man from his companions who said: ‘I read the answer from Abu Abdullah (asws) to a man from his (asws) companions.

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Bin Yazi’e, from his uncle Hamza Bin Yazi’e and Al-Husayn Bin Muhammad Bin Al-Ashary, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Abdullah, from Yazeed Bin Abdullah, from the one who narrated to him said: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) wrote to Sa’ad Al-Khayr: - In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Having said that, I (asws) hereby bequeath to you to fear Allah (azwj) for therein is safety from destruction and a gain during the returning (to Allah (azwj)). Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Protects the servant by means of his piety from whatever his intellect was remote from; and by means of piety he gets clarity from his blindness and his ignorance. And it was by piety that Noah (as) got salvation and those who were with him (as) in the ark got safety from the storm. And it was by piety that the patient ones succeeded and survived from the calamities, and they have brethren upon that path seeking those preferences, having renounced their insolence and their intentions by the desires when the examples from the Book reached them. They praised their Lord (azwj) on what He (azwj) has Sustained them with and that He (azwj) was the One (azwj) Deserving of the Praise, and they blamed their own selves upon what they had wasted and that they themselves were deserving of the condemnation. And they knew that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, is the Forbearing, the Knowledgeable, however, He (azwj) is Angry on the one who does not care about His (azwj) Pleasure and (as a result) He (azwj) Withholds from the one who does not accept His (azwj) Favours, and but rather the one does not accept guidance from Him (azwj) goes astray. Then it is possible for the sinful people to turn to the repentance and change to the doing of good deeds. He (azwj) has Called His (azwj) servants in the Book to that with a Loud Voice. He (azwj) Never Cut-off nor Prevented the calling of His (azwj) servants. So Allah (azwj) has Cursed the ones who conceal what Allah (azwj) has Revealed, and Obligated upon Himself (azwj), the Mercy to be before the Wrath. So He (azwj) Completed the Truth and the Mercy, so there is no beginning for the servant with the Wrath before he arouses His (azwj) Anger, and that is from the knowledge of certainty and the knowledge of piety. And every community from whom Allah (azwj) has Raised the Knowledge from them (Taken away), the Knowledge of the Book is when they rejected it, and befriended His (azwj) enemies when they made them to be the rulers. And from their rejection of the Book was that they established its letters and distorted its Limits. So they were narrating it but were not acting upon it. And the ignorant ones were pleased with the preservation of the narrations, whereas the scholars became aggrieved at their abandonment of the correct aspects of the narrations. And from their rejection of the Book was that they made such people as rulers who did not know, so they took them (in a direction) of wherever their own desires led them, and released them to the death (ruination). They amended the ties of the Religion, and then they left it as a legacy among the foolish and the childish (people). So the community was issued with the commands devised by the people instead of the Commands of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and it is to them that they referred to. So evil it was what the unjust took in exchange, the governance of the people instead of the Governance of Allah (azwj), and took the reward of the people instead of the Reward of Allah (azwj), and the pleasure of the people instead of the Pleasure of Allah (azwj). So this is how the community has become, and among them were those who strived (The Mujtahids) in the worship upon that misguidance. They (the people) were fascinated by them, and admired them, and their worship became a strife (Fitna) for them as well as those who followed them, whereas in the Messengers (as) there was a Reminder for the worshippers. Of these Prophets (as) was a Prophet (as) who was complete in his (as) worship, but then he (as) disobeyed Allah (azwj) Blessed and High in one aspect, so he (as) was exited from the Paradise, and he (as) was thrown into the belly of the whale. Then he (as) was not rescued until he (as) recognised (Al-Wilayah) and repented. So understand that there are similar ones to ‘Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan’ who go around concealing the Book, and alter it. So their business did not give them any gain and they were not of the guided ones. Then understand those that are similar to them in this community who establish the letters of the Book and alter its Limits. So they are with the chiefs and the notables, and when they disperse there are guided by the desires and they are with those who have a lot of the world (wealth), and that is what has reached to them from the knowledge. They do not cease to be like that in the copying (emulating) and the greed. The voice of Iblees (la) does not cease to be heard from their tongues with the falsehood, a great deal. The scholars observe patience from them from the harm that they (asws) suffer and their bullying, whereas they themselves blame the scholars for having burdened them. And the scholars in themselves are disloyal for having concealed the advice when they see a lost and strayed one with no guidance to him, or for not having revived a dead one. So evil it is what they do because Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Taken a Covenant to them in the Book that they would enjoin the doing of good and by what He (azwj) has Ordered for, and forbid them from what He (azwj) has Forbidden them from, and that they would help each other upon the goodness, and the piety, and will not co-operate upon the sins and the animosity. So the scholars are in a struggle in their efforts from the ignorant ones, that if they give good advice, the people would say that they have transgressed. And if they come to know the truth which they had avoided, they would say that they have opposed. And if they quit they would say that they have separated, and they say, ‘Give us your proof on what you are narrating’, they would say that they have become hypocrites, and if they obey them, they would say that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has been disobeyed. So the ignorant ones are destroyed in what they do not know, unlettered in what they recite. They ratify the Book when it is defined and deny it in its altered state (Meaning they accept the present altered one and reject the original one which they consider to be the altered one), and so they are not deniers as such. They are similar to Al-Ahbaar and Al-Rahbaan, leaders in matters of desires and chiefs in matters of ruination, and others from among them are seated in between the misguidance and the guidance, not understanding one community from the other. They are saying that the people do not know this, not will they return to what it used to be. And they are right. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) left them upon the clarity, its night from its day. No innovations appeared among them, nor was the Sunnah changed among them. There was no opposition from them or differences among them. So what made the people to be covered in darkness of their errors (sins) is when two imams appeared, one (asws) calling to Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and one calling to the Fire. At that time Satan (la) spoke in a loud voice by the tongues of his (la) friends and numerous were his horsemen, and infantry, and he included them in the wealth and the sons, the ones who associated with him (la). So they acted by the innovations, and avoided the Book and the Sunnah, whereas the Guardians (asws) of Allah (azwj) spoke by the Proof and took to the Book and the Wisdom. So from that day on, the people of the truth separated from the people of the falsehood. The people of guidance were abandoned and insulted, whilst the people of the misguidance helped each other until they became a group with so and so, and the like of him. So, understand this type, and the other type and look at them by the eyes of the excellent ones, and be firm with them until you come to your family, for the losers are the one who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Judgement. Indeed! That is the clear loss’. (Up to here is the report of Al-Husayn, and in the report of Muhammad Bin Yahya this is the extra bit). ‘They (people of the truth) know the path, if without them (asws) there are afflictions do not hold it against them (asws). If without them (asws) there is tyranny from the tyrannous people, and sinking of the earth and other afflictions, it will soon pass, then you will travel to the prosperity (through them (asws)). Then know that the reliable brothers are an ammunition, some of them for the other. Had it not been that you would leave from me (asws) due to your conjectures, I (asws) would have clarified for you certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept covered, and would make public certain things from the truth which I (asws) have kept concealed, but I (asws) fear for you, and want you to remain (alive), and it is not for the forbearing person that he would not fear for anyone in the place of the piety, and the forbearance is the robe of the scholar, so do not be without it. ‘Salam’ (peace be with you)’.",

        "englishText": "17. Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Bin Yazi’e, from his uncle Hamza Bin Yazi’e who said: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) wrote to Sa’d Al-Khayr: - ‘In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful. Having said that, your letter came to me (asws) in which you have asked how much it is necessary to learn and the obedience to the one (asws) whose pleasure is the Pleasure of Allah (azwj). So then you had said to yourself, then you will not be blamed if you then avoid some other. You are (also) amazed (by the fact) that the Pleasure of Allah (azwj), and obedience to Him (azwj), and His (azwj) Advice is neither accepted, nor found, nor recognised except within the servants who are unrecognised (unknown to public), who are alone (away) from the people. The people have taken them in ridicule and they ascribe to them evil matters to the extent that it was said that one cannot be a Believer and is not a Believer until he becomes more hated by the people than the carcass of a donkey. And if you suffer from the affliction similar to what we (asws) have suffered, so do not consider the strife of the people (against you) like a Punishment of Allah (azwj), and I (asws) seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) as well as for you all from that, to Bring near your destination which though is a far distance. And know, may Allah (azwj) have Mercy upon you, that one cannot achieve the Love of Allah (azwj) except by hatred from a lot of the people, nor His (azwj) Wilayah except by being their enemy, and losing (their friendship) is very little in comparison to that which is Gained from Allah (azwj), for a people who know. O my (asws) brother, verily Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Made regarding everyone from the Messengers (as) a successor (as) who remains, from the people of the knowledge, calling the one who has strayed towards the guidance, and observes patience along with them upon the suffering, answering to the Call of Allah (azwj) and calling towards Allah (azwj). So look at them (asws), may Allah (azwj) have Mercy upon you, for they (asws) are in a high position even though they would be in affliction in the world and considered to be menial. They (asws) revive the dead by the Book of Allah (azwj), and they (asws) visualise by the Light of Allah (azwj) from the blindness. How many who had been killed by the Iblees (la) were revived by them (asws), and how many lost and strayed ones were guided by them (asws), sacrificing their (asws) blood to save the servants from destruction, and how good are their (asws) effects upon the servants, and how ugly are the effects of the people against them (asws)’.",

        "englishText": "18. A number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, from Muhammad Bin Suleyman, from his father, from Abu Baseer who said: ‘One day the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) was explaining (matters) in a session, when Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) came over. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) said to him (asws) that: ‘In you (asws) there is a similarity with Isa (as) Bin Maryam (as), and had it not been for a sect from my (saww) community saying regarding you (asws) what the Christians are saying regarding Isa (as) Bin Maryam (asws), I (saww) would have said regarding you (asws) such words that none from the people would pass by you (asws) except that he would take the dust from under your (asws) feet seeking Blessings by that’. He (asws) said: ‘Two Arabs became angered along with Al-Mugheira Bin Sho’bat as well a number from the Qureish among them. So they said, ‘He (saww) was not happy until he (saww) struck an example for the son (asws) of his (saww) uncle (as) with Isa (as) Bin Maryam (as)’. So Allah (azwj) Revealed unto His (azwj) Prophet (saww) Saying: “[43:57] When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamour thereat (in ridicule)! [43:58] And they say: Are our gods better, or is he? They do not set it forth to you save by way of disputation; Ineed, they are a contentious people. [43:59] He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him an example for the children of Israel [43:60] And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you” meaning the Clan of Hashim (as), “succeeding each other on the earth” He (asws) said: ‘Al-Haaris Bin Amro Al-Fahry became angry and said, ‘Our Allah (azwj)! If this was the truth from You (azwj) that the Clan of Hashim (as) will be inheriting from Heraclius and after Heraclius, so Rain upon us stones from the sky or Bring down upon us a Grievous Punishment’. So Allah (azwj) Revealed against the words of Al-Haaris and this Verse Came down: “[8:33] But Allah was not going to chastise them while you were among them, nor is Allah going to chastise them while yet they ask for forgiveness”. Then he (saww) said to him: ‘O Ibn Amro, either you repent or you leave’. He said, ‘O Muhammad (saww), but you (saww) have made for all of the Qureish something from what is in your (saww) hands, for the Clan of Hashim (as) have taken away the prestige of the Arabs and the non-Arabs’. The Prophet (saww) said to him: ‘That is not up to me (saww), but that is up to Allah (azwj) Blessed and High’. He said, ‘O Muhammad (saww), my heart does not incline me for the repentance, but I shall leave from you’. So he called for his ride and rode away. When he came to the back of Al-Medina, a stone fell upon him and crushed his skull. Then Revelation Came to the Prophet (saww) Saying: “[70:1] One demanding, demanded the chastisement which must befall [70:2] Upon the disbelievers, of the Wilayah of Ali (asws) which none can repel [70:3] From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways”. He (the narrator) said, ‘I said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), we do not read it like this’. He (asws) said: ‘By Allah (azwj)! Jibraeel Descended with it upon Muhammad (saww), and by Allah (azwj), this is how it is recorded in the Parchment (Mus’haf) of Fatima (asws)’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) said to those who were around him (saww) from the hypocrites: ‘Go to your companion, for he has got what he was seeking for’. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[14:15] And they asked for Judgement and every insolent opposer was disappointed”.",

        "englishText": "21. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Hamaad Bin Isa, from Ibrahim Bin Usman, from Sulaym Bin Qays Al-Hilaly who said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) preached, so he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), then sent greetings of peace ‘Salam’ upon the Prophet (saww), then said: ‘Indeed! From the fears what I (asws) fear for you are two categories – following of desires and long hopes. As for the following of desires, so it will sway you away from the truth, and as for the long hopes, so they will make you forget the Hereafter. Indeed! The world has moved backwards (away from you) and that the Hereafter has moved forward (towards you), and for each of these are sons. So become from the sons of the Hereafter and do not become from the sons of the world, for today is the day of the deeds and there is no Reckoning, but tomorrow is the (day of) Reckoning and no (room to perform) deeds. However, the commencement of the strife ‘Fitna’ occurs from the following of desires, and (the man made) rules are followed in opposition to the Commands of Allah (azwj), so that a man would rule over a man (using these rules). Indeed! Surely the truth, had it been pure, there would have been no differing, and had the falsehood been pure, there would have been no fear about the one with the proof, but they take a fistful from this and a fistful from this, so they are mixed together. So that is where the Satan (la) rules over his (la) friends, and the ones for whom goodness has preceded from Allah (azwj) escape from this. I (asws) heard the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) saying: ‘How will your condition be when you are clothed in ‘Fitna’ (strife) in which the young ones will grow older while the adults would become elderly. The people will flow towards it (fitna) and take it as a Sunnah. So if something is altered therein, they will say, ‘The Sunnah has been altered’, and the people would have become deniers. Then the affliction would intensify, and the offspring would become captivated and the ‘Fitna’ (strife) would consume them just as the fire consumes the firewood, or just as the millstone grinds upon its lower base. And they would learn the Laws for the sake of other than Allah (azwj), and they would learn for the sake of other than doing good deeds, and they will be coveting the world instead of working for the Hereafter. Then he (asws) turned his (asws) face towards those from his (asws) family and his (asws) special ones and his (asws) Shiites who were around him (asws), so he (asws) said: ‘The rulers before me (asws) acted in opposition to the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) deliberately breaching the Covenant with him (saww) and altering his (saww) Sunnah. And if I (asws) had burdened the people on avoiding it, and turned it back to its place and to what is used to be in the era of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), my (asws) army would disperse from me (asws) to the extent that there would remain only myself (asws) or a few from my (asws) Shiites who recognise my (asws) ‘Fazilat’ (virtues). And my (asws) Imamate has been Obligated from the Book of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj). Consider (what would happen) if I (asws) were to order for the Maqaam e Ibrahim (as) to be returned to its place where it was placed by the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and returned the (plantation of) Fadak to the inheritors of Fatima (asws), and returned to the ‘Sa’a’ (unit of measurement) to just as it was before, and execute the treaties which were made by the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) for the people, which were never executed nor were those ever established, And return the house of Ja’far (as) to his (as) inheritors, and demolish it from the Masjid, and rescind the inequitable Judgements which were judged and remove the women who are under (married to) certain men without right and return them back to their husbands, and issue the order regarding the matrimony, and the orders regarding the captives of the Clan of Taghlub, and return what was distributed from the land of Khyber, and erase the register of gifts and give it out as the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) used to give it out in an equitable manner and not make it to be distributed between the rich, and drop Al-Musahaat (currency), and equalise between the marriages, and enforce the Khums of the Messenger (saww) just as it had been Commanded by Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic and make it to be obligatory, And return the Masjid of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) to what it used to be, and shut what was in it from the doors, and open what has been closed in it, and prohibit the wiping (Masaah) upon the socks, and enforce the punishment upon the partaking of Al-Nabeedh (intoxicant), and make the two Mu’tah’s to be permissible, and order for the Takbeer over the dead body as five Takbeers, and necessitate the people to recite ‘In the Name of Allah (azwj) the Beneficent the Merciful’ aloud (in the Prayer), and throw out the one who has been included with the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) in his (saww) Masjid the one whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had thrown out, and enter the one who had been thrown out after the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) whom the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) had included, And burden the people to the Commands of the Quran and upon the divorce to be in accordance with the Sunnah, and take the charities upon its types and its limits, and return the ablution and the (major) ablution and the Prayer to its prescribed times, and its laws and its places, and return the people of Najraan to their own places, and return the Persian captives, and the rest of the community to the Book of Allah (azwj) and the Sunnah of its Prophet (saww). By Allah (azwj), they would disperse from me (asws) if I (asws) were to order the people not to gather in the Month of Ramadhan except for the obligatory (Prayers) and make it known to them that their gathering for the optional Prayers (Nawaafil) is an innovation. So some of the people in my (asws) army would call out to the ones who are fighting alongside me (asws), ‘O people of Al-Islam! The Sunnah of Umar has been changed. He (asws) is preventing us from the optional Prayer in the Month of Ramadhan, and I (asws) had feared that there would be a revolt in a section of my (asws) army. What will be meted out from this community from the sectarianism and the obedience to the imams of the misguidance and their calling to the Fire if I (asws) were to give out from that the share of the near relatives about which Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[8:41] if you believe in Allah and in that which We revealed to Our servant, on the day of distinction, the day on which the two parties met”. So we (asws) are the ones Meant by the near relatives whom Allah (azwj) has Joined with Himself (azwj) and with His (azwj) Messenger (saww). So the High Said: “[59:7] it is for Allah and for the Messenger, and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, so that it may not be a thing taken by turns among the rich of you, and whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it, and from whatever he forbids you, keep back and be careful of Allah (of being unjust to the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww)); surely Allah is severe in retributing (evil)” to the one who is unjust to them (asws). (This is) a Mercy from Him (azwj) to us (asws) and a self-sufficiency by which Allah (azwj) has Made us (asws) to be self-sufficient with. And He (azwj) Bequeathed for it to His (azwj) Prophet (saww) and did not Make for us (asws) a share in the charity. Allah (azwj) Honoured His (azwj) Messenger (saww) and Honoured us (asws) the People (asws) of the Household, that He (azwj) should Feed us (asws) from the dirt of the people (charity). They belied Allah (azwj), and belied His (azwj) Messenger (saww) and fought against the Book of Allah (azwj) which Speaks of our (asws) rights, and prevented from us (asws) the obligation which Allah (azwj) has Obligated for us (asws). What has been meted out to us (asws) after our (asws) Prophet (saww), and Allah (azwj) is the Helper against the one who is unjust to us (asws), and there is no Might and no Power except by Allah (azwj) the High, the Magnificent’.",

        "englishText": "22. Ahmad Bin Muhammad Al-Kufy, from Ja’far Bin Abdullah Al-Muhammady, from Abu Rawh Faraj Bin Qurrat, from Ja’far Bin Abdullah, from Mas’adat Bin Sadaqa who has narrated: Abu Abdullah (asws) having said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon at Al-Medina. So he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj) and sent greetings of peace (Salam) upon the Prophet (saww). Then he (asws) said: ‘Having said that, Allah (azwj) Blessed and High does not Break the backs of the tyrants except after giving them respite and (Giving them) Ease, and does not mend the broken bones of the nations except after Removing the affliction from them. O you people! With every corruption that you come across, and setback endured from every mishap is a lesson for you, and not every heart is intelligence nor is every with an ear a listener, nor is every one with a looking eye has vision. Servants of Allah (azwj)! Do good deeds in what your eyes can see, then look at the Plains (Day of Judgement) to which Allah (azwj) will Drive those who in His (azwj) Knowledge were upon the Sunnah of the Children of the Pharaoh (la), the ones who possessed the gardens, and fountains, and plantations, and spacious places. Then look at what was the end Allah (azwj) had for them after the pleasure and enjoyment, and what they used to order for and prevent from. And for the one who is patient from among you will end up in the Gardens (of the Paradise), and Allah (azwj) will Make them live for all eternity, and to Allah (azwj) is the end of all affairs. Oh how astonishing! And why should I (asws) not be astonished at the mistakes of these sects over the different arguments in their Religion whilst not maintaining the effects of the Prophet (saww) and not following the successors (asws) in their actions, and not believing in the unseen, and not excusing the faults. Goodness among them is what they understand it to be and the evil within them is what they dislike. And each one of them is an imam to himself, taking from it what he sees with a firm and strong grip and decisive reasons. So they do not cease in these inequities and it does not increase them in anything except for errors (sins), not achieving nearness (to Allah (azwj)) and it does not increase them in anything except for the distance from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. They are well pleased with each other and ratify each other (to be correct). All that is the fear of the legacy of the ‘Ummy’ Prophet (saww) and their aversion from what came to them from the News of the Originator of the Heavens and the earth. Thus they are the people of regret, and the caves of suspicion, and the people of desires and misguidance and doubts, the ones whom Allah (azwj) has Left them to their own selves and their opinions. So he is a trustworthy one with those who is ignorant of him, not being accused by the one who does not know him. So how similar they are with the animals from whom their shepherd is absent, and how regrettable are the deeds of my (asws) Shiites after the nearness of their cordiality today. How they will humiliate each other after me (asws), and how they will kill each other and be all scattered tomorrow despite having originated from one branch, trying to find victory from a direction which is not for it. Each party from among them would grab hold of one branch from it. Whichever way the branch leans to, they will lean along with it. Allah (azwj) for Whom (azwj) is the Praise, will gather those for the evil of the day of the Clan of Umayya just like He (azwj) Gathers the clouds in the autumn. Allah (azwj) will Bring them together, then He (azwj) will Make them as debris like the debris of the clouds. Then He (azwj) will Open for them the doors and they will spill out from their source like the torrent of the two gardens, the flood of Al-Aram, when He (azwj) sent to them a يَجْعَلُهُمْ رُكَاماً كَرُكَامِ السَّحَابِ ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ لَهُمْ أَبْوَاباً يَسِيلُونَ مِنْ مُسْتَثَارِهِمْ كَسَيْلِ الْجَنَّتَيْنِ سَيْلَ الْعَرِمِ حَيْثُ بَعَثَ عَلَيْهِ قَارَةً فَلَمْ mouse and the hill could not withstand against it (the flood) and its rocks came tumbling down when Allah (azwj) Shook the womb of the valleys with a severe Shaking. Then He (azwj) Transformed them into fountains in the earth restoring thereby the rights of the people and Making them to dwell in the houses of the people being a displacement of the Clan of Umayya so that they would not usurp what they usurped. Allah (azwj) will Undermine them and displace them by the boulders of Al-Aram and fill the valley of the olives by them. By the One (azwj) Who Split the seed and Brings life from it, that is going to happen. It is as if I (asws) can hear the whinnying of their horses and the humming of their men. I (asws) swear by Allah (azwj), that which is in their hands will melt, after the rise and domination in the country, like the melting of the fat over the fire. The one who dies among them would have died as a misguided one, and to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic would lead the one among them and Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic would Accept the repentance of the one who repents. And it is to Allah (azwj) that my (asws) Shiites will gather after the fragmentation of the evil day of theirs, and there is no good for anyone to Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Remembrance, but to Allah (azwj) is the good and all of the affairs. O you people! There are many who are falsifiers for the Imamate whilst not being deserving of it. And had you not procrastinated about the bitter truth, and had not weakened from the weakening of the falsehood, the ones who are not like you would have become daring against you, nor would he have become stronger the one who became stronger against you in digesting the obedience and the removal from it of its deserving ones (asws). But you are all lost just as the Children of Israel were lost in the era of Musa ibn Imran (as). By my (asws) life, your being lost will increase from after me (asws) more than Children of Israel being lost. And by my (asws) life, you will be completing, from after me (asws), the allocated time of the Sultanate of the Clan of Umayya, having gathered to the Sultan who called to the misguidance, and you will be reviving the falsehood and will be placing the truth behind your backs, and will be cutting off the relations with the people of Badr and be very remote from the sons of those who fought for the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj). And by my (asws) life, that which in their hands will melt away upon the approach of the test for the Reward and the Promise, and the allocated times passes by. And the two-tailed star will make its appearance for you from the East, and the luminous moon will make its appearance for you. So if that were to happen, return to the repentance, and know that you all follow what you see from the East on the Path of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj). So it will cure you from the blindness, and the deafness, and the dumbness, and suffice you for the justice and you would be able to discard the gross weight which is upon the necks. And Allah (azwj) is not remote except from the one who refuses, and is unjust and unfair, and take that which is not for him. “[26:227] Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!”",

        "englishText": "23. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ibn Mahboub, from Ali Bin Ra’ab abd Yaqoub Al-Sarraaj who has said: Abu Abdullah (asws) has narrated that: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), when they had pledged allegiance to him (asws) after the killing of Usman, ascended the Pulpit, so he (asws) said: ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj) Who is High and thus all is in His (azwj) possession and He (azwj) is Closer than any in the view. And I (asws) hereby testify that there is no god but Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), the last of the Prophets (as) and a Proof over the worlds, a ratification for the former Prophets (as) and was kind and merciful to the Believers. The Angels sent ‘salam’ greetings of peace upon him (saww) and upon his (saww) Progeny (asws). Having said that, O you people! The transgression (indecency) places its owner into the Fire, and the first one to transgression (commit indecency) against Allah (azwj) Majestic is His (azwj) Remembrance was Onaq the daughter of Adam (as), and the first one who was killed, whom Allah (azwj) Killed was Onaq. And the area that she occupied when seated upon the ground measured one square acre (Jarib) of the land, and she had twenty fingers and on each of her fingers were two nails like two sickles. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Made her to be overcome by a lion which was like an elephant (in size), and a wolf which was like a camel (in size), and an eagle like a mule (in size). So they killed her. And Allah (azwj) had Killed the tyrants in their best conditions, and gave Safety to those who used to be (oppressed). And He (azwj) Made Hannaan to die, and destroyed the Pharaoh (la), and He (azwj) has Killed Usman. Indeed! Your misfortunes have returned to what they were on the day Allah (azwj) Sent His (azwj) Prophet (saww). By the One (azwj) Who Sent him (saww) by the truth, you will be confused with a (severe) confusion and be sifted with a (severe) sifting, and stirred and turned like the contents of a frying pan until your underside becomes your upper side and your upper side becomes your underside. The ones who used to be with the shortcomings will become the foremost ones, and those who used to be the foremost ones would become the people with shortcomings. By Allah (azwj)! I (asws) have neither concealed, nor blocked, nor lied a lie, and I (asws) have been foretold about this place and this day. Indeed! And the sins are like uncontrollable horses which carry its riders, with its harnesses removed, plunging into the Fire. Indeed! And the piety is like a humble ride which takes its rider, along with its rein, to the Paradise, and its Doors will be opened up for them, and they will find its aroma and goodness. And it will be said to them: ‘Enter it in peace and security’. Indeed! The ones who had no association with it has preceded me (asws) to this command (Caliphate), and the ones to whom it had not been Granted to, and the ones for whom there was no chance from it except if they were to be Prophets (as) who had been Sent. And indeed! There is no Prophet (as) to be after Muhammad (saww) who is more noble than him (as) over the intercession on the brink of the Fire. So they will fall with by it (their lies) in the Fire of Hell. Truth as well as falsehood, for each of them are its people. The matter of falsehood is a very old one and has been active. And if the truth is less (in practice) it is because of ‘if’ and ‘maybe’. And it is rare that if a thing gone away comes back, and if your command (Caliphate) returns to you, you would be pleased, and it is not on me (asws) except for the striving, and I (asws) am afraid that you all will end up being on the nature of your nation (away) from me (asws), the nation that you were in beforehand and would not have a praiseworthy opinion in my (asws) sight, and if I (asws) so desire to I (asws) would say: ‘May Allah (azwj) Forgive what was in the past’. Two men preceded me (asws) with regards to it (Caliphate), and the third one stood up like the Raven. His main concern was his stomach. Woe be unto him! Had his wings been clipped and his head cut-off, it would have been better for him. He was distracted from the Paradise and the Hell was in front of him. Three and two make five, there is no sixth of them – An Angel who files by his wings, and a Prophet (as) whom Allah (azwj) has Grabbed by his (as) shoulders (Given him Divine Status), and a diligent seeker (momin), and a hopeful student, and a reducer (Muqassir) are in the Fire. The right and the left are misleading, whereas the middle path is the street on which you will come across the Book and the effects of the Prophet-hood. Destroyed is the one who makes a claim, and disillusioned is the one who fabricates that Allah (azwj) Disciplined this community by the sword and the whip, and there is no leniency for either of them with the Imam (asws). So, hide in your homes and mend your relationships in between yourselves and the repentance is behind you all. The one who turned his cheek (opposed the Imam (asws)) to the truth is destroyed.",

Abu Ali Al-Ashary, from Muhammad Bin Saalim and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father altogether, from Ahmad Bin Al-Nazar, and Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Abu Al-Qasim, from Al-Husayn Bin Abu Qatada altogether, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Jabir, who said: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said: ‘The Messenger (as) of Allah (azwj) came out for the display of the horses. He (saww) passed by the grave of Abu Ahayhat. So Abu Bakr said, ‘Curse be upon the occupant of this grave, for by Allah (azwj), he used to divert people away from the Way of Allah (azwj) and belied the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj)’. So Khalid, his (Ahayhat’s) son said, ‘But curse of Allah (azwj) be upon Abu Qohafa (Abu Bakr’s father), for by Allah (azwj), he neither served a guest nor did he kill (fight) the enemy. So Allah (azwj) has Cursed the worthless one of the two of his clan’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) placed the bridle of the horse upon his (Abu Bakr’s) neck and said: ‘Whenever you speak about the ‘Mushraqeen’ Polytheists speak in general terms and not particular, for you have anger his son’. Then he (saww) paused. The horses were displayed to him (asws). So he (saww) passed by a horse. Uyayna Bin Hisan said, ‘The matter of this horse is such and such’. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) said: ‘Leave us, for I (saww) am more knowledgeable of the horses than you are’. Uyayna said, ‘And I am more knowledgeable of the men than you (saww) are’ (Nouzobillah). So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) got angry to the extent that blood appeared in his (saww) face. He (saww) said to him: ‘So which of the men are the best?’ Uyayna Bin Hisan said, ‘The men who are in Najd place their swords upon their shoulders and their spears upon the saddles of their horses, then march with them step by step’. The Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) said: ‘You are lying. But, the men of Yemen are better. The faith is in Yemen and the wisdom is in Yemen, and had it not been for the Emigration (Hijrat), I (saww) would have been of the people of Yemen. The alienation and the cruelty is in the acreages of the owners of the cotton yarn, Rabi’ah and Muzar from where the rays of the sun appear, and (as for) Muzhaj most of the tribe will enter the Paradise, and Hazramaut is better than Aamir Bin Sa’sa (and some have reported ‘better than Haaris Bin Muawiya’) and Bajeela is better than Ra’al and Zakwaan, and if Lihyaan were to perish I (asws) would not care’. Then he (saww) said: ‘Allah (azwj) has Cursed four kings – Jamada, and Makhwasa, and Mashraha, and Abza’a, as well as Akhtam Al-Ammaradat. Allah (azwj) has Cursed Al-Muhallal (One who legalises a woman for her previous husband after three divorces from him) and the one to whom she has been made legal for, and the slave who does not obey his master, and the one who makes a claim for lineage, and the man who is effeminate (has feminine traits) and the woman who has masculine traits, and the one who innovates something new in Al-Islam or helps an innovator, and the one who kills someone other than the one who wants to kill him, or strike against someone other than the one who wants to strike him, and the one who curses his father’. So a man said, ‘O Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), is there a man who curses his own father?’ He (saww) said: ‘Yes, he who curses the fathers and the mothers of the men, so he has cursed his own father. Allah (azwj) has Cursed Ra’la, and Zakwaan, and Azla, and Lahyaan, and the criminals of Asad, and Ghatfaan, and Abu Sufyan Bin Harb, and Shahbala of two teeth, and the two sons of Malikat Bin Jazeem, and Marwaan, and Howzat and Hownat’.",

        "englishText": "29. Narrated to me Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father altogether from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Abdullah Bin Ghalib Al-Asady from his father, from Saeed Bin Al-Musayyab who said: ‘Ali Bin Al-Husayn (asws) used to advise the people and to make them to be ascetic in this world and incline them towards the deeds for the Hereafter by this speech in every Friday in the Masjid of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) which was preserved and written down. He (asws) would say: ‘O you people! Fear Allah (azwj) and know that you will be returning to Him (azwj). So each soul would find what it had done in this world from the good in recorded form, and what it had done from the evil even though there would have been between it and itself a long time. And Allah (azwj) Himself (azwj) has Cautioned you, and woe be unto you O oblivious son of Adam (as) for He (azwj) is not Oblivious of you. O son of Adam (as), your death is the quickest thing coming towards you seeking you in an aggressive manner. It would be around you when your time elapses and the Angel would capture your soul and take you to your grave alone. It would then return your soul back to you in it, and two Angels would storm into it, Naakir and Nakeer to question you and test you severely. And indeed! the first thing what they will ask you would be about your Lord (azwj) which you had worshipped, and about your Prophet (saww) who (saww) was sent to you, and about your Religion which you had made it to be, and about your Book which you recited, and about your Imam (asws) whom you had befriended. Then about your life what you had spent it on, and your wealth from where you had acquired it and in what you had spent it on. So take caution and look at yourself, and prepare the answers before the examination, and the questioning, and the test. So if you are a Believer having understood your Religion, followed the truthful ones (asws), befriended the friends of Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) will Provide your argument for you, and make your tongue to speak correctly and give good answers, and you will receive the news of the happiness and the Paradise from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. And the Angels will welcome you with joyful spirits and aromatic fragrance. If you do not become like that, your tongue will waver, and your argument will fail, and you will be unable to answer, and you will receive news of the Fire, and the Angels of Punishment will drag you into the Hell and its intense heat. And know, O son of Adam (as) that what is coming behind you on the Day of Judgement is greater and more shocking and painful for the heart. That is the Day in which all people would be Gathered and that is the Day of Witnessing. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Gather in it the former ones and the later ones. That is the Day in which the Trumpet would be Blown and the graves would be scattered. And that is the Day of tremors and the hearts would come up to the throat and the stumbling would not be reduced, and no ransom would be taken from anyone, and no excuses would be acceptable from anyone, and no repentance would be Accepted from anyone. There is nothing except for the Recompense for the good deeds and the Recompense for the evil deeds. So the one who was from the Believers having done a good deed in this world the weight of an atom would find it, and the one was from the Believers having done an evil deed in this world the weight of an atom would find it too. So be cautious, O you people from the sins and the disobedience to what Allah (azwj) has Forbidden you from and Cautioned you in His (azwj) Truthful Book, and the Speaking Proofs (asws). And do not feel secure from the Abhorrence of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Cautions and His (azwj) Threats from what the accursed Satan (la) calls you to himself (la) from the desires of short duration and the pleasures in this world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[7:201] Surely those who guard (against evil), when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them they become mindful, then lo! they see”. You must get your hearts to feel the fear of Allah (azwj) and remember what He (azwj) has Promised you regarding your returning to Him (azwj) from the good Rewards from Him (azwj), just as you fear the harsh Punishment, for the one who fears something would be cautious of it, and the one who is cautious of something would avoid it. And do not become of the oblivious ones, the ones inclined towards the flowers of the world of those who devise evil, for Allah (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Decisive Book: “[16:45] Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive? [16:46] Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not escape; [16:47] Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss” So be cautious of what Allah (azwj) has Cautioned you with what He (azwj) has Done with the unjust ones in His (azwj) Book, and do not feel secure from what has been Promised for the unjust people in the Book. By Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) has Advised you all in His (azwj) Book by way of other people. So, happy is the one who takes a lesson from the advice given to others. Allah (azwj) has Made you hear in His (azwj) Book what He (azwj) has Done with the unjust people of the town before you where He (azwj) said: “[21:11] And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish”, but rather what is Meant by the ‘town’ is its inhabitants, where He (azwj) Said: “[21:11] and We raised up after it another people!”. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[21:12] Yet, when they felt Our Punishment (coming), behold, they (tried to) flee from it. [21:13] Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account.” So when the Punishment Came upon them, they said “[21:14] They said: O woe to us! surely we were unjust [21:15] And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is mown, as ashes silent and quenched”. By Allah (azwj), let this be an Advice for you and a Warning that you should heed and fear. Then refer to the Words from Allah (azwj) in His (azwj) Book against the people of disobedience and the sins. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[21:46] And if a blast of the chastisement of your Lord were to touch them, they will certainly say: O woe to us! surely we were unjust”. O you people! If you were to say that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Meant by this the people of the ‘Mushriqeen’ (Polytheism), so how can that be and He (azwj) Says: “[21:47] And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and though there be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, (yet) will We bring it, and sufficient are We to take account.” Know, O servants of Allah (azwj), that the people of the Polytheism will not have a Balance set up for them nor will their Register (of deeds) be published and they will be herded to Hell in groups, but rather the Balance and the publishing of the Register (of deeds) will be for the people of Al-Islam. So fear Allah (azwj), O servants of Allah (azwj) and know that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Love the blossoms of the world and its temporal matters for anyone of His (azwj) friends and does not Encourage them with regards to it and regarding its temporary blossoms and apparent delights. But rather, He (azwj) Created the world and Created its people so that they may be Tested therein as to which one of them is good in deeds for his Hereafter. And by Allah (azwj), He (azwj) has Struck examples for you with regards to it and Presented Signs for the people of intellect, and there is no Strength except by Allah (azwj). So abstain yourselves from what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Told you to abstain from regarding the temporary life of the world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said, and His (azwj) Words are the Truth: “[10:24] The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.” Servants of Allah (azwj)! become of the people who reflect and do not incline towards the world, for Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said to Muhammad (saww): “[11:113] And do not incline to those who are unjust, lest the fire touch you,”, and do not incline towards the blossoms of the world and what is in it, like those who have taken it to be a house of permanent settlement for it is a lowly house, a shabby home, and a place of deeds. So make provisions in it of the good deeds before its days disperse and before the Call from Allah (azwj) for its destruction, for the One (azwj) Who Destroys it is the One (azwj) Who Built it in the first place and initiated it and He (azwj) is the Guardian of its inheritance. So I hereby ask Allah (azwj) for the Support for us (asws) and for you all for the provisions of the piety and the restraint and may Allah (azwj) Make us (asws) and you to be of the ascetics with regards to the blossoms of the life of the world and of those who are hopeful for the Rewards of the Hereafter, for we are with Him (azwj) and for Him (azwj). And Greetings of peace be upon Muhammad (saww) the Prophet and his (saww) Progeny (asws) and peace, and peace be upon you all and the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Blessings’.",

He said, ‘Salam un Allaika’ ‘Peace be upon you O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) and Mercy of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Blessings’. Then he was quiet.

Then he was quiet until all the people had answered him and returned his greetings. Then he turned his face towards Abu Ja’far (asws), then said, ‘O son (asws) of the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), allow me (to come near you (asws)), may Allah (azwj) Make me to be sacrificed for you (asws), for by Allah (azwj), I love you (asws) and love those who love you (asws), and by Allah (azwj) I don’t love you (asws) and those who love you (asws) for the greed of the world. By Allah (azwj) I hate your (asws) enemies and keep away from them, and by Allah (azwj) I do not hate them and keep away from them due to the dispute between me and them. By Allah (azwj), I permit for myself that which you (asws) have made it to be permissible, and prohibit to myself that which you (asws) have made it to be prohibited, and I await your (asws) command. So is there hope for me, may Allah (azwj) Make me to be sacrificed for you?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Come near, come near’, until he (asws) seated him by his (asws) side, then said: ‘O you old man, a man came to my (asws) father (asws) Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) and asked him similar to what you has asked me (asws). So my (asws) father (asws) said to him: ‘If you were to die you would return to the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and to Ali (asws), and Al-Hassan (asws), and Al-Husayn (asws), and Ali Bin Al-Husayn (asws). Your heart would be in delight and it would be cooled at what your eyes would recognise, and you would be welcomed by the Spirit and the fragrance along with the Honourable Scribes. If your soul reaches here’ – and he (asws) indicated by his (asws) hand to his (asws) throat – ‘and when you live you will see what delights Allah (azwj) has Kept for your eyes, and you will be with us (asws) in the highest peak’. The old man said, ‘What did you (asws) say, O Abu Ja’far (asws)’. So he (asws) repeated the words for him. The old man said, ‘Allah (azwj) is Great! O Abu Ja’far (asws), if I were to die I would return to the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), and to Ali (asws), and Al-Hassan (asws), and Al-Husayn (asws), and Ali Bin Al-Husayn (asws), and my eyes would be delighted, and my heart would be cooled, and I would be welcome by the Spirit and the fragrance along with the Honourable Scribes. If my soul reached up to here, and I will live and see what delights Allah (azwj) has Kept for my eyes, so I would be with you (asws) in the highest peak’.

Whenever he intended to go for his business needs, he would never do it unless he looked at the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) first. He became well known for that for he would stretch himself above others so that he could look at him (saww). It so happened that one day he came over to him (saww) and stretched out to look at the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) until he saw him (saww), then he went away for his business needs. It was not long before he returned. So when the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) saw him do that he (saww) gestured by his (saww) (hand) to beckon him to be seated. So he sat down in front of him (saww). He (saww) said: ‘What is the matter that you have done something which you had not done before that?’ He said, ‘O Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), by the One (azwj) Who Sent you (saww) with the Truth as a Prophet (saww), my remembrance of you (saww) overwhelmed my heart to the extent that I did not have the ability to go about my business until I returned to you (saww)’. So he (saww) supplicated for him and wished him well. Then the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) waited a few days but did not see him, so he (saww) asked about him. It was said to him (saww), ‘O Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), we have not seen him for days’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) put on his (saww) shoes, and his (saww) companions did the same and walked until he (saww) came to the oil market. At the shop of the man there was no one in it. So he (saww) asked the neighbours about him. They said, ‘O Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), he died, and he used to be a trustworthy one among us and truthful, but he had one (peculiar) habit’. He (saww) said: ‘And what was that?’ They said, ‘He used to exhaust himself following the women’. So the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj) said: ‘May Allah (azwj) have Mercy upon him. By Allah (azwj), he used to love me (saww) with (intense) love. Even if he had been a slave trader, Allah (azwj) would Forgive him’.",

I (asws) hereby inform you that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Existed and there was nothing other than Him (azwj), and He (azwj) was Mighty and there was no one who was mighty before Him (azwj), and that is His (azwj) Statement: “[37:180] Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honour, above what they describe”, and He (azwj) was the Creator before the creation, and had He (azwj) Created, and Had He (azwj) Created something from His (azwj) Creation, something from something, then there would be no cut-off from it (the chain) ever, and it would never cease if Allah (azwj) had something with Him (azwj) and He (azwj) did not precede it, but He (azwj) Existed when there was nothing other than Him (azwj). And He (azwj) Created the thing from which are all things, and it is the water from which He (azwj) Created the things. So He (azwj) Lineage everything to the water and did not Make a lineage for the water to which it can be ascribed. And He (azwj) Created the wind from the water, then Made the wind to overcome the water. So the wind sent down into the body of the water until foam swirled from the water in accordance with what He (azwj) so Desired it to swirl. So He (azwj) Created from that foam, pure white land with no crack in it, nor any holes, neither ascending nor descending, and no tree. Then He (azwj) Folded it, so He (azwj) Placed it on top of the water. Then Allah (azwj) Created the fire from the water, so the fire bust out of the body of the water until smoke arose from the water in accordance with Allah (azwj) so Desired it to rise. So He (azwj) Created from that smoke, clear and pure sky in which there were no cracks nor any holes, and that is His (azwj) Statement: “[79:27] Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it. [79:28] He raised high its height, then put it into a right good state. [79:29] And He made dark its night and brought out its light”. He (asws) said: ‘And there was no sun, and no moon, and no stars and no clouds. Then He (azwj) Folded it and Placed it upon the earth, then Established two creations. Then He (azwj) Raised the sky before the earth, so that is His (azwj) Statement, Mighty is His (azwj) Mention: “[79:30] And the earth, He expanded it after that”. He (azwj) Said that He (azwj) Spread it out’. So the Syrian said to him (asws), ‘O Abu Ja’far (asws), the Statement of Allah (azwj) the High: “[21:30] Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up, but We have opened them”. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Perhaps you think that these two used to be stuck together and there were separated from each other?’ He said, ‘Yes’. Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Seek Forgiveness from your Lord (azwj), for it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic that they were closed up, meaning that the sky used to be closed up and no rain descended from it, and the earth was closed up and did not grow any seed (vegetation). So when Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Created the creatures, He (azwj) Spread therein all kinds of animals. He (azwj) Opened up the sky by the rain and the earth by the seed’. The Syrian said, ‘I testify that you (asws) are from the children of the Prophets (as) and that your (asws) knowledge is their (as) knowledge’.",

        "englishText": "69. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ibn Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Is’haq Al-Madany, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said that: ‘The Rasool (saww) of Allah (azwj) was asked about the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[19:85] The day We shall gather the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours”, so he (saww) said: ‘O Ali (asws)! Surely the delegation will not come up except on rides. These will be the men who feared Allah (azwj), so Allah (azwj) Loved them and Specialised them and being Pleased with their deeds and therefore they have been named as the pious ones’. Then he (saww) said to him (asws): ‘O Ali (asws)! By the One (azwj) Who Split the seed and Brought life out of it, they will be coming out from their graves and the Angels will be welcoming them by a she-camel from the she-camels of honour on which will be saddles of gold crowned with pearls and sapphire, and it will be covered in brocade and silk, and its braid will be purple, and it will fly with them to the place of Resurrection. Along with every man from them will be a thousand Angels in front of them, and on his right, and on his left escorting them with an (honourable) escort until they will end up with them to the Great Door of the Paradise. And at the Door (Entrance) of the Paradise is a tree, a leaf from it can give shade to a thousand men from the people under it. And on the right of the tree is a fountain pure and clear’. He (saww) said: ‘They will quench themselves with a drink from it, so Allah (azwj) will Purify their hearts by it from the ‘الْحَسَدِ’ (jealousy/envy), and their bodily hair will drop off, and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[76:21] and their Lord shall make them drink a pure drink”. It will be from that pure fountain’. He (saww) said: ‘Then they will leave to go to another Fountain on the right of the Tree. So they will bathe in it, and it is the Fountain of (everlasting) Life, and so they will not be dying ever’. He (saww) said: ‘Then they (the she-camels) will pause by them in front of the Throne, and they would have been made safe from the diseases and the illnesses and the heat and the cold for all eternity’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘Then the ‘الْجَبَّارُ’ (Compeller (azwj)) Majestic, Who cannot be Described (by any means), will Say to the Angels who will be with them: “Usher My (azwj) friends to the Paradise and do not pause them with the creatures from I (azwj) am already Pleased with them and My (azwj) Mercy has been Obligated for them, and how can I (azwj) Want them to be paused, the companions of the good with that of the evil?’ He (saww) said: ‘The Angels will lead them to the Paradise. So when they end up with them at the Great Entrance of the Paradise the Angels will knock hard on the door. Its pleasant sound will reach every Hourie whom Allah (azwj) has Prepared for His (azwj) friends in the Gardens. They (Houries) will give them the good news of it when they hear the pleasant sound of the ring (door bell), so some of them will say to the others, ‘The friends of Allah (azwj) have come to us, so open the Door for them’. They will enter the Paradise and their respective wives from the beautiful Houries and the humans will welcome them by saying, ‘Congratulations to you for we have been intensely eager in our desire to be with you’, and the friends of Allah (azwj) will say to them similarly’. Ali (asws) said: ‘O Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj)! Inform us about the Statement of Allah (azwj); “[39:20] But it is for those who fear their Lord. That lofty mansions, one above another, have been built”, O Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj)’. So he (saww) said: ‘O Ali (asws)! Those are mansions which Allah (azwj) has Built for His (azwj) friends from the pearls, and the sapphire, and the emeralds, and their ceilings are of gold interwoven with silver. For each of the mansions are a thousand doors of gold upon each of which is an Angel allocated to it. In them are raised couches, one on top of the other from the silk, and the brocades of different colours, and their filling is of musk, and the camphor and ambergris, and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[56:34] And raised couches”. When the Believer enters his house in the Paradise, a crown of kingship and prestige would be placed upon his head, and he will be dressed in the clothes of gold, and silver, and the rubies, and the crystals arranged in designs as a wreath under the crown’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘And he will be dressed in seventy garments of silk of different colours, struck with different designs with gold, and the silver, and the pearls, and the red sapphire. So that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[22:23] they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk”. So when the Believer sits upon his bed, it will vibrate with joy. When the friend of Allah (azwj) settles down in his house in the Paradise, the Angels allocated to his Garden will seek permission from him so as to congratulate him for the honour Bestowed upon him by Allah (azwj), and they will come to him. So the servants of the Believer from the butlers and the maids will say to them, ‘Stay in your place, for the friend of Allah (azwj) is leaning upon his couch, and his Hourie wife is grooming herself for him, therefore wait for the friend of Allah (azwj)’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So his Hourie wife will come out to him from her tent, walking to welcome him, and around her will be her maids, and upon her would be seventy garments interwoven with the sapphire, and the pearls, and the emeralds, and scented with musk, and ambergris. And upon her head would be a crown of prestige, and she would be wearing shoes of gold laced with sapphire and pearls, and their laces will be of red sapphire. So when she approaches the friend of Allah (azwj), he would understand it and he would get up for her in desire, so she will say to him, ‘O friend of Allah (azwj), this is not a day of tiredness and suffering, so do not get up. I am for you and you are for me’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So they will hug each other for a duration of five hundred years from the years of the world. Neither will he get weary of her nor will she get weary of him. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So when he calms down without being disheartened from her, he will look at her neck, so he will see on her a necklace embedded with red sapphire. In the midst of it would be a panel of pears on which would be written, “You, O friend of Allah (azwj) is my beloved, and I am the Hourie, beloved to you. My self is devoted to you and your self is devoted to me”. Then Allah (azwj) will Send to him a thousand Angels to congratulate him for being in the Paradise and having been married to the Hourie’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So they will end up to the first of the doors of his Gardens. They will say to the Angel allocated for that door of his garden, ‘Grant us permission to the friend of Allah (azwj), for Allah (azwj) has Sent us to him to congratulate him’. The Angel will say to them, ‘Wait until I inform the guard to inform him of your places’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So the Angel would come up to the guard, and in between the guard and him would be three Gardens until he will end up at the first door. So he will say to the guard that, ‘A thousand Angels are awaiting at the door, having been Sent by the Lord (azwj) of the world, Blessed and High, to congratulate the friend of Allah (azwj) and have asked me to grant them permission to see him’. The guard will say to the Angel, ‘This is difficult for me that I should permit anyone to the friend of Allah (azwj) as he is with his Hourie wife’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘And in between the guard and the friend of Allah (azwj) are two Gardens’. He (saww) said: ‘So the guard will come up to the supervisor and say to him that, ‘At the door are a thousand Angels whom the Lord (azwj) of Honour has Sent to congratulate the friend of Allah (azwj), so grant them permission’. The supervisor will proceed to the servants and say to them that, ‘A thousand Angels are at the door whom Allah (azwj) has Sent to congratulate the friend of Allah (azwj), so make their places known to him’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘So they will make it known to him, and he will tell him to grant permission to the Angels. So they will come up to the friend of Allah (azwj), and he would be in a mansion of his, and there will be a thousand doors in it, and at each door of its doors would be an Angel allocated to it. So he will allow the Angels to enter to be with the friend of Allah (azwj) by opening one door for each of the Angels to enter by. The supervisor would then allow each of the Angels from the door of the doors of the Mansion’. He (saww) said: ‘So they would then convey the Message of the Compeller (azwj) Majestic and Mighty to him and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[13:23] and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate”, from the doors of the Mansion, “[13:24] Peace be on you” - up to the end of the Verse’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘And that is the Statement of the Majestic and Mighty: “[76:20] And when you see there, you shall see blessings and a great kingdom”, meaning by that the friend of Allah (azwj) and what he would be in from the Prestige and the Bounties, and the Magnificent and Great Kingdom. The Angels Sent by the Message from Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, would seek permission for their entrance to him. So they do not come up to him except by his permission. So that is the Magnificent and Great Kingdom’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘And the rivers would flow from underneath his dwelling and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[18:31] These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow”. And the fruits would come near to them and it is the Statement of Mighty and Majestic: “[76:14] And close down upon them (shall be) its shadows, and its fruits shall be made near (to them) (as in humility), being easy to reach”. The Believer would eat from the varieties of fruits by its category whilst leaning (relaxed upon the couch), and the varieties of the fruits will say to the friend of Allah (azwj), ‘Eat me before you eat this one’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘And there is none from the Believer in the Paradise except that for him would be numerous Gardens, with a gazebo or without a gazebo, and rivers of pure drinks, and rivers of water, and rivers of milk, and rivers of honey. So if the friend of Allah (azwj) calls to partake a meal, he would be given whatsoever he desires for from the foods without even having named his desire’. Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘Then he would seclude himself with his wife, and some of them would visit each other, and they would enjoy in their Gardens in extended shade, similar to what is between the break of dawn to the rise of the sun, and better than that. Each of the Believer would have seventy wives from the Houries, and four women from the humans, and the Believer would spend an hour with the Hourie, and an hour with the human (wife), and an hour alone with himself, being relaxed leaning on his couch, some looking at some others’. The Believer would be covered by a shining beam of light and he would be upon his couch, and he would say to his servants, ‘What is this beam of light? Perhaps it is the Brilliance of the Compeller (azwj) Who has Observed me’. His servants would say to him, ‘Holy is He (azwj)! Holy is He (azwj)! Majestic is His (azwj) Majesty! But, this is a Hourie from your women (wives) whom you have never entered into. She just looked out of her tent towards you in her desire for you, and wants to present herself to you, and would love to meet with you. So when she saw you relaxed upon your couch, she smiled in her desire for you. So that was the brilliant beam that you saw and the light which you were covered in, it was from the whiteness of her mouth (teeth), and her cleanliness, and her purity, and her tenderness’. He (saww) said: ‘So the friend of Allah (azwj) would say, ‘Grant her permission’. So a thousand servants and a thousand maids would descend to her to give her the good news of that. So she would then come to him from her tent, and she would have upon her seventy garments interwoven with the gold, and silver, laced with gems and the sapphire, and the emeralds cover with musk and ambergris, of different colours. The marrow of her leg would be seen from underneath the seventy garments of seventy cubits of length, and the (distance) between her shoulders would be of ten cubits. So when she approaches the friend of Allah (azwj), the servants would welcome her by a tray of gold and the silver in which would be gems, and the sapphire, and the emeralds, so they would display these to her. Then he would embrace her and she would embrace him. So neither would he be weary nor would she be weary’. He the (narrator) said, ‘Then Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘But rather the Gardens Mentioned in the Book are the Garden of Eden, and the Garden of Al-Firdows, and Garden of Naeem, and Garden of Al-Ma’wa’. He (asws) said: ‘And Allah (azwj) has Surrounded these Gardens with other Gardens, and that the Believer would be able to have for him from the Gardens whichever one what he loves, and wants and enjoy wherever he so likes to. And if the Believer intends a thing, or covets it, he would call for it by saying, ‘Glory be to You (azwj), our Allah (azwj)!’ So if he says it, the servants would keep coming to him with what he had coveted for even without him having asked them for it or commanded them for it, and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[10:10] Their cry in it shall be: Glory to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting in it shall be: ‘سَلامٌ’ Peace”, meaning the servants’. He (asws) said: “[10:10] and the last of their cry shall be: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”, meaning by that after their having had their enjoyment from the copulation, and the food, and the drinks, they will be Praising Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic during their being free from that’. And as for His (azwj) Statement: “[37:41] For them is a Sustenance determined”, he (asws) said: ‘The servants know of it, so they bring it to the friend of Allah (azwj) before he even asks them for it’. And as for the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[37:42] Fruits, and they shall be highly honoured”, he (asws) said: ‘They will not desire anything in the Paradise, except that they will be honoured with it’.",

A number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Ali Bin Ra’ib, from Abu Ubeyda Al-Haza’a, from Suweyr Bin Abu Fakhta who said: I heard Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) narrating in the Masjid of the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) saying: ‘Narrated to me (asws) by my (asws) father (asws), and he (asws) heard it from his (asws) father (asws) Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws) narrating to the people saying: ‘When it will be the Day of Judgement, Allah (azwj) will Resurrect the people from their graves in their isolation, without beards, in one plane, being driven by the light, and Gather them in the darkness until they are paused upon the hurdle on the Place of Resurrection. So, some of them will climb upon the others, becoming over crowded. They will be prevented from passing. Their breathing will be heavy and they will sweat profusely, and their affairs would be constricted, their noises would intensify, and their voices would be raised. He (asws) said: ‘This will be the first sensation from the sensations of the Day of Judgement’. He (asws) said: ‘The Compeller (azwj) Blessed and High will Attend to them from above His (azwj) Throne in the shadow of the Angels, so He (azwj) Command an Angel from the Angels who would call out among them: ‘O group of creatures! Listen, and listen intently to the Caller of the Compeller (azwj)’. He (asws) said: ‘So the last of them would hear it just as the first of them’. He (asws) said: ‘Their voices would break up due to that, and they will anxiously look around and their body parts would become restless, and their hearts would be in a panic, and they will be raising their heads towards the direction of the voice hastening to the Caller’. He (asws) said: ‘So when that happens, the Infidel would say, ‘This is a difficult day’. He (asws) said: ‘So the Compeller (azwj) Mighty and Majestic would Attend to be the Judge over them, so He (azwj) will Say to them: “I (azwj) am Allah (azwj). There is no god except for Me (azwj). I (azwj) am the Equitable Judge Whom will not Let any injustice be done today. I (azwj) Shall Judge between you all with Justice and Equity. No one will be done injustice in My (azwj) Presence today. I (azwj) shall Take the rights for weak ones from the strong ones and for those who have suffered injustices will be retaliation from the good deeds and the sins as compensation and be Rewarded for the gifts. And no one will be Permitted today in My (azwj) Presence, as an unjust one or one to whom injustice has been done except if he waives his right against the other one, and I (azwj) shall Take from him (the unjust one) during the Accounting correlated. O you creatures! And seek what is due to you from the one who was unjust to you for it in the world, and I (azwj) am a Witness for you against them, and I (azwj) am sufficient as a Witness’. He (asws) said: ‘So they will recognise each other and seize the opportunity. So not one would remain for whom there would be anything from the unjust one any right except that he would claim for it’. He (asws) said: ‘So they would do that for as long as Allah (azwj) so Desires. Their condition would become difficult, and they will sweat profusely, and their grief would intensify, and they would be raising their voices by intense noise. So they would wish to be finished from it by letting go of their rights and not bother to claim for it from the unjust ones’. He (asws) said: ‘And Allah (azwj) would Know of their struggles, so a Caller would Call out from the Presence of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High which the last of them would hear as well as the first of them: ‘O group of creatures, listen intently to the Caller of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and listen to what Allah (azwj) Blessed and High is Saying to you all: ‘I (azwj) Am the Bestower and would Love it if you would gift (forego) each other and if you do not then I (azwj) will Take it for you from the one who was unjust to you’. He (asws) said: ‘So they would become happy with that due to their difficult struggles, and constriction, and their behaviour and contention’. He (asws) said: ‘So some of them would forego their rights in the hope that it would finish them from the situation that they would be in, and there would remain some of them who would say, ‘O Lord (azwj), our rights are greater than us being able to forego them’. He (asws) said: ‘So a Caller would Call out from beside the Throne: ‘Where is Rizwaan, the keeper of the Gardens of Al-Firdows?’ He (asws) said: ‘So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Command him to display from Al-Firdows a castle of silver with whatever is inside it from the construction and the servants’. He (asws) said: ‘The butlers and the servants would be seen on the grounds of the castle’. He (asws) said: ‘So a Caller would Call out from the Presence of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High: “O group of creatures! Raise your heads and look at this castle’. He (asws) said: ‘So they will be raising their heads, and each one of them would wish for it’. He (asws) said: ‘So a Caller will Call out from the Presence of Allah (azwj): “O group of creatures! This is for every one forgives a Believer’. He (asws) said: ‘So all of them would be forgiving except for a few’. He (asws) said: ‘So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic will Say: “There is no Permission to My (azwj) Paradise today for the unjust one, and there is no Permission today to the Fire today for the one who was oppressed, or anyone from the Muslims who has in his possession somebody’s rights until it will be Taken from him during the Accounting. O you creatures! Be prepared for the Accounting’. He (asws) said: ‘Then their way would be cleared for them, so they will be moving to the next stage preparing one another until they end up at the Plains, and the Compeller (azwj) Blessed and High would be upon the Throne. The registers (of deeds) would have been published, the scales set, and the Prophets (as), and the witnesses (asws), and these would be the Imams (asws) would be present. Each Imam (asws) testifying over the people of his (asws) era, having stood among them by the Command of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and called them to the Way of Allah (azwj)’. He (asws) said: ‘So a man from Qureish said to him (asws), ‘O son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj), if there is a Believing man who has a claim against an infidel man, which thing would be taken from the infidel, and he is from the inhabitants of the Fire?’ He (asws) said: ‘Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) said to him: ‘The sins of the Muslim would be taken from him in accordance with what is due to him from the infidel, so the infidel would be Punished by it along with his Punishment for his infidelity in accordance with what was for the Muslim before that right’. He (asws) said: ‘So the Qureishi said to him (asws), ‘So if there was a right for a Muslim against a Muslim, how would it be taken from a Muslim?’ He (asws) said: ‘The good deeds would be taken for the oppressed against the oppressor in accordance with the right of the oppressed and it would increase the good deeds of the oppressed one’. He (asws) said: ‘The Qureishi said to him (asws): ‘If the oppressor does not have any good deeds to his credit?’ He (asws) said: ‘If the oppressor does not have any good deeds to his credit, the sins of the oppressed would be taken from him so it would increase the sins of the oppressor’.",

        "englishText": "92. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Al-Fuzeyl, from Abu Hamza, who has said: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said that: ‘Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Covenanted to Adam (as) that he (as) would not go near the tree. When the time came which was in the Knowledge of Allah (azwj), he (as) ate from it. He (as) ate from it in forgetfulness and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[20:115] And certainly We gave a commandment to Adam before, but he forgot; and We did not find in him any determination”. So when Adam (as) ate from the tree, he (as) came to the earth. There were born to him (as) Habeel (as) and his (as) sister as twins, and there were born to him (as) Qabeel (la) and his (la) sister as twins’. Adam (as) ordered Habeel (as) and Qabeel (la) that they should make an offering. And Habeel (as) was a shepherd and Qabeel (la) was a farmer. Habeel (as) presented a ram from the best of his (as) sheep, and Qabeel presented from his farm what had not ripened yet. So the offering of Habeel (as) was Accepted and the offering of Qabeel (lar) was not Accepted, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[5:27] And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with truth when they both offered an offering, but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other” up to the end of the Verse. And it was that the offering was consumed by the Fire. So Qabeel (la) resorted to the Fire and built for it a house and it was the first of the houses to be built for the fire. He (la) said, ‘I (la) will worship this fire until my (la) offering is Accepted from me (la)’. Then Iblees (la) came to him (la) and he (la) used to flow in the son of Adam (la) like the flowing of blood in the veins. So he (la) said to him (la), ‘O Qabeel (la)! The offering of Habeel (as) has been Accepted whilst your (la) offering has not been Accepted, and if you (la) were to leave him (as), his (as) descendants would pride themselves over your (la) descendants and they will be saying to them, ‘We are the descendants of the one (as) whose offering was Accepted’. So kill him (as) so that he (as) would not have descendants to be able to gloat over your (la) descendants’. So he (la) killed him (as). When Qabeel (la) returned to Adam (as), he (as) said to him (la): ‘O Qabeel (la), where is Habeel (as)?’ He (la) said, ‘Seek him (as) where we offered the offerings’. So Adam (as) went and found Habeel (la) murdered. Adam (as) said: ‘Curse be upon the land which accepted the blood of Habeel (as). And Adam (as) wept upon Habeel (as) for forty nights. Then Adam (as) asked his (as) Lord (azwj) for a son. So a boy was born to him (as) and he (as) named him (as) as Hibbat Allah (Gift of Allah (azwj)) because Allah (azwj) Gifted him (as) to him (as), and his (as) sister as twins. So when the Prophet-hood of Adam (as) came to an end, and his (as) days were complete, Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (as): “O Adam (as)! Your (as) Prophet-hood has ended and your (as) days are completed, so make the Knowledge which is in your (as) possession, and the Belief, and the Great Name, and the inheritance of the Knowledge, and the effects of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood to be in your (as) descendants to be in the possession of Hibbat Allah (as), for I (azwj) will never Cut off the Knowledge, and the Belief, and the Great Name, and the effects of the Prophet-hood from your (as) progeny up to the Day of Judgement, and will never Leave the earth except that there will be in it a knowledgeable one by whom My (azwj) Religion would be recognised, and obedience to Me (azwj) would be recognised, and salvation would lie in the ones born between you (as) and between Noah (as)”. And Adam (as) gave him (as) the good news of Noah (as) so he (as) said: ‘Allah (azwj) will be Sending a Prophet (as) whose name is Noah (as) and he (as) would call to Allah (azwj) is His (azwj) Mention, but his (as) people would belie him (as). So Allah (azwj) would Destroy them by the storm’. And in between Adam (as) and Noah (as) were altogether ten generations of Prophets (as) and successors (as). And Adam (as) bequeathed to Hibbat Allah (as) that: ‘The ones among you (as) who would meet him (as) should believe in him (as), and follow him (as), and ratify him (as) for he (as) would save you from drowning (loosing faith)’. Then Adam (as) became ill with an illness in which he (as) passed away, so he (as) sent for Hibbat Allah (as) and said to him (as): ‘If you meet Jibraeel or meet any of the Angels, so covey greetings from me (as) and say to him: ‘O Jibraeel, my (as) father (as) will be guiding you from the fruits of the Paradise’. Jibraeel said to him (as): ‘O Hibbat Allah (as), your (as) father (as) has been Captured (passed away) and we are descending to Pray on him (as), so return’. He (as) returned and found Adam (as) to have passed away. Jibraeel showed him (as) how to wash him (as). So he (as) washed him (as) until when he (as) came to Pray over him (as). Hibbat Allah (as) said: ‘O Jibraeel, go forward and Pray over Adam (as)’. Jibraeel said to him (as): ‘Verily Allah (azwj) has Commanded us that we should prostrate to your (as) father (as) whilst he (as) was in the Paradise, so it is not for us to lead anyone from his (as) sons’. So Hibbat Allah (as) led the Prayed over his (as) father and Jibraeel and the army of the Angels were behind him (as) and Exclaimed Takbeer over him (as) thirty times. So Jibraeel was ordered (to announce) for twenty-five exclamations of Takbeer to be lifted from it and the Sunnah of today is of five Takbeers, whilst the exclamations (Takbeers) over the people of Badr were nine and seven’. Thereafter, when Hibbat Allah (as) had buried his (as) father (as), Qabeel (la) came up to him (as) and said, ‘O Hibbat Allah (as)! I have seen my (la) father (as) that he (as) had specialised you (as) with the Knowledge by what he (as) had not specialised me (la) with, and it was the Knowledge by which your (as) brother (as) Habeel (as) had supplicated by. So his (as) offering was Accepted, therefore I (la) killed him (as) so that his (as) descendants would not be able to gloat over my (la) descendants by saying, ‘We are the sons of the one (as) whose offering was Accepted whilst you are the sons of the one (lar) whose offering was unsuccessful’. So if you (as) were to display anything from the Knowledge which your (as) father (as) has specialised you (as) with, I (la) will kill you (as) just like I (la) killed your (as) brother Habeel (as)’. So Hibbat Allah (as) and the descendants from him (as) continued with what was in their possession, in a fearful (observing Taqeeya) manner, the Knowledge, and the Belief, and the Great Name, and the inheritance of the Prophet-hood, and the effect of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood until Allah (azwj) Sent Noah (as) and the will of Hibbat Allah (as) was displayed. When they (the descendants) look in the bequest of Adam (as) they found Noah (as) as a Prophet (as) the good news which Adam (as) had given them of. So they believed in him (as), and followed him (as) and ratified him (as). And Adam (as) had bequeathed to Hibbat Allah (as) that he (as) should frequently refer to the will during the start of every year and make it to be a day of Eid for them. They did that during the era of Noah (as) and the time of his (as) coming out and that is what has come in the will of every Prophet (as) until Allah (azwj) Sent Muhammad (saww), and they recognised Noah (as) by the Knowledge which was in their possession, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[11:25] And certainly We sent Nuh to his people” up to the end of the Verse. And there were in between Adam (as) and Noah (as), Prophets (as) who were in hiding and it is for that reason their (as) mention is hidden in the Quran. So they (as) have not been named as have been named the proclaimed Prophets (as), greetings be upon all of them (as), and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj); “[4:164] And (We sent) Rasools We have mentioned to you before and Rasools we have not mentioned to you”, meaning the hidden ones from the Prophets (as) have not been named as the proclaimed ones have been named. Noah (as) lived among his (as) people for a thousand years less fifty (950) years. He (as) did not associate anyone in his (as) Prophet-hood for he (as) had come to a people who had rejected the Prophets (as) who were between him (as) and Adam (as) and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[26:105] The people of Nuh rejected the Rasools”, meaning the ones (as) who were in between him (as) and Adam (as) to end in His (azwj) Statement, the Mighty and Majestic: “[26:191] And most surely your Lord is Mighty, the Merciful”. So when the Prophet-hood of Noah (as) came to an end and his (as) days were completed, Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (as) that: “O Noah (as)! Your (as) Prophet-hood has come to an end and your (as) days are completed, so make the Knowledge which is in your (as) possession, and the Belief, and the Great Name, and the inheritance of the Knowledge, and effects of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood, to be in the descendants from your (as) progeny, for I (azwj) will never Cut it off from the houses of the Prophets (as) which is your (as) house and between Adam (as), and I (azwj) will never Leave the earth except that there will be in it a knowledgeable one by whom My (azwj) Religion would be recognised by, and obedience to Me (azwj) would be recognised by, and salvation would lie in the ones who are born during what is in between the Capture (passing away) of a Prophet (as) up to the coming out of another Prophet (as). And Noah (as) gave the good news of Hud (as) to Saam (as) and there were Prophets (as) in between Noah (as) and Hud (as). And Noah (as) said that Allah (azwj) will Send a Prophet (as) called Hud (as), and he (as) would call his (as) people to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. They would belie him (as) and Allah (azwj) will Destroy them by the wind. So the ones among you who meet him (as) should believe in him (as), and follow him (as) for Allah (azwj) would Rescue him from the Punishment of the wind. And Noah (as) ordered his (as) son (as) Sam (as) that he (as) should look at this bequest at the start of every year and make it to be a day of Eid for them. So they observed that which was in their possession from the Knowledge, and the belief, and the Great Name, and the inheritance of the knowledge, and effects of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood. They found Hud (as) as a Prophet (as) and their father Noah (as) had given them the good news of him (as) beforehand. So they believed in him (as), and followed him (as), and ratified him (as), and were therefore Rescued from the Punishment of the wind, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[7:65] And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud”, and the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[26:123] (The people of) A’ad denied the Rasools (of Allah). [26:124] When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?”, and the Blessed and High Said: “[2:132] And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did) Yaqoub”, and His (azwj) Statement: “[6:84] And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub and Made it to be in his (as) Household ; each did We guide, and Nuh did We guide before,” and Made it to be in his (as) Household, so the descendants of the Prophets (as) believed in them (as), and those that lived before Ibrahim (as) believed in Ibrahim (as). And there were Prophets (as) in between Ibrahim (as) and Hud (as) and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj); “[11:89], nor are the people of Lut far off from you”, and His (azwj) Statement, Mighty is His (azwj) Mention: “[29:26] And Lut believed in Him, and he said: I am fleeing to my Lord”, and the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[29:16] And (We sent) Ibrahim, when he said to his people: Serve Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him; this is best for you, if you did but know”. So there came in between every two Prophets (as), ten, or nine, or eight Prophets (as), and all of them were Prophets (as), and there happened for every Prophet (as) what happened for Noah (as), as is what had happened to Adam (as), and Hud (as), and Salih (as), and Shuayb (as), and Ibrahim (as) until it ended up to Yusuf Bin Yaqoub (as). Then, from after Yusuf (as) it went to the grandsons until it ended up to Musa (as). And there were Prophets (as) in between Yusuf (as) and Musa (as). So Allah (azwj) Sent Musa (as) and Haroun (as) to Pharaoh (la), and Hamaan (la), and Qaroun (la). “[23:44] Then We sent Our Rasools one after another; whenever there came to a people their Rasool, they called him a liar, so We made some of them follow others and We made them stories”. And the Children of Israel killed a Prophet (as), and if two were established they killed two, and four would be established, to the extent that sometimes they killed seventy Prophets (as) in one day, and they set up the market and killed them (as) at the end of the day. So when the Torah was Revealed unto Musa (as), it gave the good News of Muhammad (saww), and in between Yusuf (as) and Musa (as) were Prophets (as). And Musa (as) had bequeathed to Yoshua bin Noon (as) and he (as) was the young man whom Allah (azwj) Mentioned in His (azwj) Book. The Prophets (as) never ceased to give the good News of Muhammad (saww) until Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Sent the Messiah Isa Bin Maryam (as). So he (as) gave the good News of Muhammad (saww) and that is the Statement of the High: “[7:157] they find meaning the Jews and the Christians written down with them meaning the description of Muhammad (saww) in the Taurat and the Injeel (who) enjoins them good and forbids them evil,” and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[61:6] And when Isa son of Marium said giving the good news of an Rasool who will come after me, his name being Ahmad,”, and Musa (as) and Isa (as) gave the good news of Muhammad (saww) just as the Prophets (as) had given to one another until it reached Muhammad (saww). So when the Prophet-hood of Muhammad (saww) came to an end, and his (saww) days were completed, Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Revealed unto him (saww): “O Muhammad (saww)! Your (saww) Prophet-hood has come to an end and your (saww) days are completed, so make the Knowledge which is in your (saww) possession, and the Belief, and the Great Name, and inheritance of the Knowledge, and effects of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood to be in the People (asws) of your (saww) Household in the possession of Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws), for I (azwj) will never Cut off the Knowledge, and the belief, and the Great Name, and inheritance of the Knowledge, and effects of Knowledge of the Prophet-hood from the descendants of your (saww) Progeny (asws) just as I (azwj) never Cut it off from the Houses of the Prophets (as) which were in between you (saww) and your (saww) father Adam (as), and that is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High: “[3:33] Surely Allah chose Adam and Nuh and the descendants of Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above the nations [3:34] Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing”. And Allah (azwj) Blessed and High never Makes the Knowledge to be among the ignorant ones, and never Allocates His (azwj) Command to anyone from His (azwj) creatures, not even to an Angel of Proximity, and not to a ‘نَبِيٍّ مُرْسَلٍ’ Mursal Nabi (as), but He (azwj) Sends Rasools from His (azwj) Angels and Said to him: “Say such and such”. So He (azwj) Commanded them with what He (azwj) Loves and Prohibited them from what He (azwj) Abhors. So He (azwj) Related to them the affairs of His (azwj) creatures by the Knowledge. So He (azwj) Taught that Knowledge, and Taught His (azwj) Prophets (as), and His (azwj) and the specials ones from the Prophets (as), and the brothers, and the descendants who were one from another, so that is the Statement of the Majestic and Mighty: “[4:54] But indeed We have given to Ibrahim’s children the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a grand kingdom”. So, as for the Book, it is the Prophet-hood, and as for the Wisdom, so they (as) are the wise ones from the Prophets (as) from the elite, and as for the Great Kingdom, so they (asws) are the Imams (asws) of the guidance from the elite, and all of these are from the descendants who were one from the other. And the knowledgeable ones are the one whom Allah (azwj) has Made to be among them the remainders, and in them (asws) is the eventual end, and the preservation of the Covenant until the world comes to an end. And the knowledgeable ones and the Guardians of the Command (Wali Ul Amr) are the interpreters of the Knowledge and the guidance. So this is the Glory of the elite and the Rasools (as), and the Prophets (as), and the Wise ones, and the Imams (asws) of guidance, and the Caliphs who are the Guardians of the Command of Allah (azwj), and the interpreters of the Knowledge of Allah (azwj), and the people of the effects of the Knowledge of Allah (azwj) from the descendants who are one from another from the elite after the Prophets (as) from the fathers, and the brothers, and the descendants from the Prophets (as). So the ones who sought protection by the merit ended up with their (as) Knowledge and were rescued by their (as) help, and the ones who placed the Guardians of the Command of Allah (azwj) and the people of the interpretation (Istanbaat) in others than the elites from the Houses of the Prophets (as) have opposed the Command of Allah (azwj), and made the ignorant ones to be as the guardians of the command of Allah (azwj) (wali al-amr), and the pretenders without guidance from Allah (azwj) and they claim that they are the ones who are the people of interpretation (Istanbaat) of the Knowledge of Allah (azwj), so they have belied against Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Rasool (saww), and disregarded his (saww) successor (asws) and being obedient to him (asws), and did not place the Preference of Allah (azwj) where Allah (azwj) Blessed and High had Placed it. So they went astray and led astray those who followed them, and there will be no argument for them on the Day of Judgement. But rather, the Proof is among the Progeny of Ibrahim (as) as is in the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[4:54] But indeed We have given to Ibrahim’s children the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a grand kingdom”. So the Proofs are the Prophets (as) and the People of the Household of the Prophets (as) until the Establishment of the Hour (Day of Judgement), because the Book of Allah (azwj) Speaks of that, the Will of Allah (azwj) some of them from the other which has been Placed upon the people, so the Mighty and Majestic Said: “[24:36] In houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted”, and these are the Houses of the Prophets (as), and the Rasools (as), and the Wise ones, and the Imams (asws) of Guidance. So these is the explanation of the firm belief by which gained salvation the ones who were before you, and by it was the Rescued the ones who followed the Imams (asws). And Allah (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Book: “[6:84] And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub; each did We guide, and Nuh did We guide before, and of his descendants, Dawood and Sulaiman and Ayub and Yusuf and Haroun; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others). [6:85] And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas; every one was of the good [6:86] And Ismail and Al-Yasha and Yunus and Lut; and every one We made to excel (in) the worlds [6:87] And from among their fathers and their descendants and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them into the right way”. “[6:89] These are they to whom We gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy; therefore if these disbelieve in it We have already entrusted with it a people who are not disbelievers in it”, for it has been Entrusted to the People from their (as) Household, and the brothers, and the descendants, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High that if your people were to deny it so He (azwj) has Entrusted it to the People (asws) of your (saww) Household with the Belief which He (azwj) Sent you (saww) with. So they will never deny it ever, and will not waste the Belief which you (saww) have been Sent with, the People (asws) of your (saww) Household from after you (saww), the knowledgeable ones (Ulamaa) of your (saww) community, and the Guardians of My (azwj) Command (Wali Al-Amr) after you (saww), and the people of the interpretation (Istinbaat) of the Knowledge in which there is lie, and no sin, and no forgery, and no arrogance, and no showing off. So this is the explanation of what ended up to him (saww) of the matters of the community. Allah (azwj) Purified the People (asws) of the Household of His (azwj) Prophet (saww), and asked them (the people) for the recompense of the cordiality (Muwaddat), and Made the ‘Wilayah’ to flow for them (asws), and Made them (asws) to be the successors (asws), and His (azwj) Beloved ones. He (saww) Established it after him (saww) in his (saww) community: ‘O you people! Learn a lesson from what I (saww) am saying to you. The place where Allah (azwj) has Placed His (azwj) Wilayah, and obedience to Him (azwj), and His (azwj) cordiality, and the interpretation of His (azwj) Knowledge, and His (azwj) Proofs, so these (asws) are the ones. So accept them (asws), and attach yourselves to them (asws) in order to be Rescued by it, and it will become an argument for you on the Day of Judgement, and the Path of your Lord (azwj) Majestic and Mighty. And you cannot arrive to the Wilayah of Allah (azwj) except through them (asws). So the one who does that would have the right for Allah (azwj) to Honour him and not Punish him. And the one who comes to Allah (azwj) without what He (azwj) has Commanded for, would have become deserving for Allah (azwj) to Humiliate him and Punish him’.",

A number of our companions, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Khalid, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Abu Hamza Sabit Bin Dinar Al-Thamaly and Abu Mansour, from Abu Al-Tabi’e who said: ‘We went on Pilgrimage with Abu Ja’far (asws) in the year in which Hisham Abdul Malik was performing the Pilgrimage as well, and along with him was Nafa’u, the retainer of Umar Bin Al-Khattaab. So Nafa’u looked towards Abu Ja’far (asws) in the corner of the House and the people had gathered around him’. Nafa’u said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, who is this one around whom the people have gathered?’ He said, ‘This is a Prophet of the people of Al-Kufa. This is Muhammad (asws) Bin Ali (asws)’. He said, ‘Be a witness for I shall ask him (asws) about certain matters that nobody can answer with regards to it except for a Prophet (as) or a son (asws) of a Prophet (as), or a successor (asws) of a Prophet (as)’. He said, ‘So go ahead and ask him (asws), perhaps you can embarrass him (asws)’. So Nafa’u came until he leaned upon the people, until he was higher than Abu Ja’far (asws). He said, ‘O Muhammad (asws) Bin Ali (asws)! I have read the Torah, and the Evangel, and the Psalms, and the Furqaan (Quran), and have understood their Permissibles, and their Prohibitions, and I have come to ask you (asws) about certain matters that none can answer with regards to it except for a Prophet (as), or a successor (asws) of a Prophet (as), or son (asws) of a Prophet (as)’. He (the narrator) said, ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) raised his (asws) head and said; ‘Ask, or shall I (asws) begin for you?’ He said, ‘Inform me, how many years were there in between Isa (as) and Muhammad (saww)?’ He (asws) said: ‘Shall I (asws) inform you in accordance to your words or to mine (asws)?’ He said, ‘Inform me in accordance to both together’. He (asws) said: ‘In accordance to my (asws) words, so there were five hundred years, and in accordance to your words there were six hundred years’. He said, ‘So inform me about the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic to His (azwj) Prophet (saww): “[43:45] And ask those of Our Rasools whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Beneficent Allah?” who was the one that Muhammad (saww) asked since there were five hundred years in between him (saww) and Isa (as)?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘This is the Verse: “[17:1] Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing”, so Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Showed to Muhammad (saww) certain Signs when He (azwj) Made him (saww) to travel to the Bayt Al-Maqdas, was that Allah (azwj) Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, Resurrected from the former ones and the later ones, Prophets (as) and Rasools (as), then Commanded Jibraeel (as) to Call out the Adhaan and the Iqamah. And he said in his Adhaan “Hurry to the Best of the deeds” (Hayya Ala Khayr Al-Amal). Then Muhammad (saww) proceeded and Prayed with the people. When he (saww) had finished, he (saww) asked them: ‘What did you testify to and what did you worship?’ They replied, ‘We testified that there is no god except Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), and that you (saww) are the Rasool (saww) of Allah (azwj), and it is upon that, that He (azwj) Took a Covenant from us and the Confirmation’. So Nafa’u said, ‘You (asws) have spoken the truth, O Abu Ja’far (asws)! So Inform me about the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[21:30] Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up, but We have opened them”. He (asws) said: ‘When Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Sent Adam (as) to the earth, and the skies were closed up and did not rain at all, and the earth was closed up and did not grow any vegetation. So when Allah (azwj) Accepted the repentance of Adam (as), He (azwj) Commanded the sky, so it collected rain in the clouds. Then He (azwj) Commanded it, so it allowed it to fall. Then He (azwj) Commanded the earth, so it produced the trees, and the fruits, and the rivers flowed. So that is (what is meant by) ‘closed up’, and this is (what is meant by) ‘it opened up’’. Nafa’u said, ‘You (asws) had spoken the truth, O son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) of Allah (azwj). So inform me about the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[14:48] On the day when the earth shall be changed into a different earth, and the heavens (as well)”. Which earth would it be replaced by on the Day?’ So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘It will be the ground which would become edible, from which they will be eating until such time as Allah (azwj) has Completed the Accounting’. Nafa’u said, ‘They would be busy (with the accounting) instead to eating’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Would they be busy on that Day or would they be in the Fire?’ Nafa’u said, ‘But they would be in the Fire’. He (asws) said: ‘By Allah (azwj), they would not be busy, it’s just that when they call for the food, so they will be fed the Zaqoom (a tree in Hell), and they will call for drink and they will be quenched with Al-Hameem (a river of Hell)’. He said, ‘You (asws) has spoken the truth, O son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) of Allah (azwj), and there remains one question’. He (asws) said: ‘And what is that?’ He said, ‘Inform me about Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, when (did He (azwj) Exist) from?’ He (asws) said: ‘Woe be unto you. When was he (azwj) not from that I (asws) inform you when He (azwj) was from? Glory be to the One Who (azwj) always Was and will never cease to Be, Alone, Eternal, He (azwj) has not Taken any associate nor a son’. Then he (asws) said: ‘O Nafa’u, inform me of what I (asws) ask you about’. He said, ‘And what is it?’ He (asws) said: ‘What do you say about the companions of Nahrwaan (a battle), for if you say that Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) killed them rightfully, therefore they were apostates, and if you were to say then he (asws) killed them wrongly, so you would have blasphemed’. He (the narrator) said, ‘He turned around from those that were with him, and he was saying, ‘By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are truly the most knowledgeable of the people’. So he came to Hisham who asked, ‘What did you do?’ He said, ‘Leave me from your speech. By Allah (azwj), this one (asws) is truly the most knowledgeable of the people, and he (asws) is truly the son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) of Allah (azwj), and his (asws) companions are quite right in taking him (asws) as a Prophet (as)’.",

He made him (asws) to stay in his accommodation, and he (asws) used to sit with the people in their gatherings. It so happened that he (asws) was sitting and in his (asws) presence was a group of people asking him, when he (asws) saw Christians entering inside a mountain over there. So he (asws) said: ‘What is with those, is it one of their festivities today?’ They said, ‘No, O son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj), but they are going to one of their scholars who (stays) inside this mountain all year long, and on this day he has come out. So they are asking him questions what they want and what is to happen in their year’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘And he has knowledge?’ They said, ‘He is one of the most knowledgeable of the people. He has met the companions of the disciples of Isa (as)’. He (asws) said: ‘Shall we go to him?’ They said, ‘That is up to you (asws), O son (asws) of the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj)’. He (the narrator) said: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) covered his (asws) head by his (asws) cloth, and went with his (asws) companions. He (asws) mingled with the Christians until he (asws) came to the mountain. Abu Ja’far (asws) sat down in the middle of the Christians along with his (asws) companions, and the Christians brought out a carpet and placed the pillows. Then they entered and brought him out with his eyes covered. His eyes stirred as if they were the eyes of a snake. Then he inadvertently turned towards Abu Ja’far (asws) and asked, ‘O Sheykh, where are you (asws) from, or are you (asws) from the Mercied community?’ So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘But, I (asws) am from the Mercied community’. He said, ‘Are you (asws) from their knowledgeable ones or from their ignorant ones?’ He (asws) said: ‘I (asws) am not from the ignorant ones’. The Christian said, ‘Shall I ask you or you will ask me?’ Abu Ja’far said: ‘Ask me (asws)’. So the Christian said, ‘O group of Christians, a man from the community of Muhammad (saww) is saying, ‘Ask me!’. This one is full of answers’. Then he said, ‘O servant of Allah (azwj), inform me about the hour which is neither from the night, nor from the day. Which hour is it?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘That which is in between the dawn and sunrise’. So the Christian said, ‘So if it is neither an hour from the hours of the night, nor from the hours of the day, from which is it?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘From the hours of the Paradise, and in which our patients are relieved (from pain). So the Christian said, ‘Shall I ask you (asws) or will you ask me?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Ask me (asws)’. The Christian said, ‘O group of Christians, this one here is full of knowledge. Inform me about the inhabitants of the Paradise. How would they be eating but will not be excreting? Give me their example in the world’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘The unborn (baby) which is in the womb of its mother eats from what its mother eats but does not excrete’. So the Christian said, ‘Did you not say, ‘I (asws) am not from the knowledgeable ones?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘But rather, I (asws) said to you that I (asws) am not from the ignorant ones’. So the Christian said, ‘Shall I ask you (asws) or will you (asws) ask me?’ Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Ask me (asws)’. He said, ‘O group of Christians! By Allah (azwj), I will ask him about a matter which would bog him (asws) down just as the donkey gets bogged down in the mud’. He (asws) said to him: ‘Ask’. He said, ‘Inform me about a man who approached his woman, so she became pregnant with twins in the same one hour, and gave birth to both of them in the same one hour, and they both died in the same one hour, and were buried in the same one grave. One of them lived for one hundred and fifty years whilst the other one lived for fifty years. Who were those two?’ So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Uzayr and Uzrat. Their mother became pregnant with them both as you have described, and gave birth to both of them as you have described, and both Uzayr and Uzrat lived for such and such a time. Then Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Made Uzayr to die for a hundred years, then Resurrected him, and he lived with Uzrat for fifty years, and both of them died in the same one hour’. So the Christian said, ‘O group of Christians. I have not see with my eyes ever a more knowledgeable one than this man (asws). Do not ask me about a single letter (anything at all) so long as this one is in Al-Shaam. Return me’. He (the narrator) said, ‘So they returned him to his cave, and the Christians returned with Abu Ja’far (asws)’.",

        "englishText": "95. A number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, from Ismail Bin Mahraan, from Muhammad Bin Mansour Al-Khuzai’e, from Ali Bin Suweyd and Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from Muhammad Bin Ismail Bin Yazi’e, from his uncle Hamza bin Yazi’e, from Ali Bin Suweyd and Al-Hassan Biin Muhammad, from Muhammad Bin Ahmad Al-Nahdy, from Ismail Bin Mahraan, from Muhammad bin Mansour, from Ali Bin Suweyd who said: ‘I wrote to Abu Al-Hassan Musa (asws) whilst he (asws) was in the solitary confinement. I wrote asking him (asws) about his (asws) condition and about numerous matters. The answer did not come for months, then he (asws) answered me by an answer and this is its copy: - In the Name of Allah (azwj) the Beneficent, the Merciful. Praise be to the High, the Magnificent. It is by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Light the hearts of the ‘الْمُؤْمِنِينَ’ (believers) achieve vision, and by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Light, (whereas) the ignorant ones are inimical to Him (azwj), and by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Light crave the ones in the heavens and in the earth and to Him (azwj) is the Means by the different deeds and the contradictory Religions. So the rightful, and the mistaken, and the stray, and the guided, and the hearing, and the deaf, and the seeing, and the blind ones are perplexed. So the Praise Belongs to Allah (azwj) Whose Religion was recognised and described by Muhammad (saww). Having said that, you are of the people whom Allah (azwj) has Blessed by Sending the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww) (towards you and) and by special status, and Preserved the cordiality which attracted you to His (azwj) Religion, and what He (azwj) has Inspired from your guidance and your vision from the matters of your Religion that you give preference to them (asws) and are referring your matters to them (asws). You wrote to me (asws) asking me (asws) about matters which I (asws) was observing dissimulation in and concealed them for a while. So when the authority of the tyrant passed by, and there came the authority of the One (azwj) with Great Authority, by my (asws) departing from the world which has been condemned by its inhabitants who have hardened themselves against their Creator, I (asws) saw that I (asws) could explain to you what you had asked me (asws) about, fearing that our (asws) weak Shiites may enter into confusion because of the ignorance which is in front of them. So fear Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, and single out for these matters, its deserving ones, and be cautious that you should become a reason for the calamities against the successors (asws) or provoking (people) against them (asws) by publicising what I (asws) am entrusting you with and exposing what I (asws) have told you to conceal, and Allah (azwj) Willing, you will not do this. Firstly what I (asws) would like to inform you is that you should mourn for myself (asws) in this very night without remorse and no complaints, for what is to transpire is from what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Ordained and is inevitable. So attach yourself to the Handle of the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and the Firmest Handle of the successor (asws) after the successor (asws), and the submission to them (asws) and be pleased with what they (asws) say, and do not seek Religion from the ones who are not from your Shiites, and do not love their Religion, for they are traitors who have betrayed Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Rasool (saww), and betrayed their trusts. And do you know how they betrayed their trusts? They were entrusted with the Book of Allah (azwj) so they distorted it and changed it, and evidenced it upon the rulers among them. So stay away from them. Allah (azwj) has Made them to Taste the clothing of the hunger, and the fear due to what they had done. And you asked about two men (Abu Bakr and Umar) who usurped the wealth of a man which he used to spend upon the poor and the needy and the traveller in need, and in the Way of Allah (azwj). So when they usurped that, they were not happy until they made him carry it unwillingly upon his ride to their own homes. When they undertook to be in charge of its spending, and so reached infidelity by doing that. By my (asws) life, they had become hypocrites before that and rejected against Allah (azwj) His (azwj) Words, and mocked at His (azwj) Rasool (saww), and they were both infidels. May Allah (azwj) Curse them, and the Angels, and the people altogether. By Allah (azwj), the ‘Eman’ (belief) did not enter into the heart of any one of them since their coming out from their condition (Kufr), and it did not increase them in anything except for doubts. They were deceivers, sceptical, hypocrites until they both died and the Angels of Punishment took them to the place of disgrace in the eternal abode. And you asked about those who were in the presence of that man whilst he was usurping his wealth and placed it upon his ride, and there were among them who knew about it and denied it. So those (Abu Bakr and Umar) are the first apostates from this community, and so may the Curse of Allah (azwj) and the Angels and all the people be upon them. And you asked about extent of our (asws) Knowledge, and it is upon three aspects. The past, and the future, and the newly recurring. So as for the past, it has been explained, and as for the future, it has been written down, and as for that which is newly occurring, so it gets imprinted upon the hearts, and resonated in the ears, and it is the highest of our (asws) Knowledge, and there is no Prophet (as) after our (asws) Prophet (saww). And you asked about the mothers of their children (the followers of those two), and about their marriages, and about their divorces. So, as for the mothers of their children, they are prostitutes up to the Day of Judgement, having married without a guardian (Wali’s consent), and going through divorces without (completing the) waiting periods. And as for the one who enters into our (asws) Invitation (call to Wilayah), so his ‘Eman’ demolishes his misguidance, and so does his ‘Yaqeen’ conviction (demolish) his doubts. And you asked about the Zakaat among them. So, there was nothing from the Zakaat (for them), as you are more deserving of it, because we (asws) have made that to be lawful for you, and those who are from you wherever they may be. And you asked about the weak. So the weak is the one who cannot argue against (the batil) and he does not understand the differences, for if he understands the difference, then he is not with the weakness. You asked about the ‘الشَّهَادَاتِ’ testimonies for them. So establish the testimony for the sake of Allah (azwj), even if it is against your own-self, and the parents and the relatives in what is between you and them. So if you fear injustice against your brother, don’t (be part of it). And call to the Law of Allah (azwj), as He (azwj) has (placed those) in our (asws) recognition (Ma’rifat). The one who hopes would be Answered and do not barricade yourself by the fort of hypocrisy. And befriend the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww) and do not speak of what reaches you from us (asws), and ascribe to us that ‘this is false’, and you may know something from us (asws) which is against it, for you do not know why we (asws) may have said it, and upon which perspective we may have described it. Believe in what I (asws) inform you (asws) and do not publicise what I (asws) have told you to conceal from what I (asws) inform you. It is from the obligatory right of your brother that you do not conceal anything from him which might benefit him in the affairs of the world and the Hereafter. And do not hold a grudge against him and not to hurt him, and answer his call when he calls you and do not leave him alone between him and his enemies from the people even though they may be closer to you than him, and support him in his illness. It is not from etiquettes of the ‘الْمُؤْمِنِينَ’ Believers, the defrauding, and the injuring, and the treachery, and the arrogance, and the vulgarities, and the immoralities, and the commanding for such things. So if you were to see the deformed Bedouin in legions (large armies), so wait for your relief (Al-Qaim (asws)), and for your Shiites, the believers, and when the sun rises, raise your vision to the sky and look at what Allah (azwj) has Done with the criminals. So I (asws) have explained to you all of this in summary. And send greetings upon Muhammad (saww) and his (saww) Progeny (asws), the righteous’.",

Humeyd Bin Ziyad, from Al-Hassan Bin Muhammad Bin Sama’at, from Muhammad Bin Ayyub and Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father altogether from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Abu Nasr, from Abaan Bin Usmaan, from Abu Baseer, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) having said: ‘Abu Dharr (ar) came to the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) and said, ‘O Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj), I (asws) have begun disliking Al-Medina. Will you (saww) permit me (asws), and that I (ar) and the son of my (ar) brother go out to Muzeyna, for we are from it?’ He (saww) said: ‘I (saww) fear that you (ar) might be attacked by Arab horsemen, so they would kill the son of your (ar) brother and you will come to me (saww) beaten up, and stand in front of me (saww) leaning upon your stick and you will say, ‘The son of my (ar) brother has been killed, and the cattle taken away’. He (ar) said, ‘O Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj), but nothing will happen except for the good, Allah (azwj) Willing’. So the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) gave him (ar) permission. So he (ar) and the son of his (ar) brother, and his (ar) wife went out. But, very soon the horsemen of the Clan of Fazaarat, among whom was Uyaynah Bin Hasan attacked them, took away the cattle, and killed the son of his (ar) brother, and took his (ar) wife who as from the Clan of Ghaffaar. And Abu Dharr (ar) came up in an intensely difficult condition and paused in front of the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj), badly wounded and leaning upon his stick and said, ‘Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Rasool (saww) were right. The cattle were taken, and the son of my (ar) brother being killed, and I (ar) am leaning upon my stick’. So the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) cried out among the Muslims. So they went out in the search, and returned the cattle, and killed a number from the Polytheists’.",

A flooding came in between him (saww) and his (saww) companions. A man from the Polytheists saw it, and the Muslims were standing upon the edge of the valley waiting for the flood to be cut-off (subside).

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Qasim Bin Muhammad, and Ali Bin Muhammad, from Al-Qasim Bin Muhammad, from Suleyman Bin Dawood Al-Munkary, from Hafs Bin Gayaas, who has said: Abu Abdullah (asws) having said: ‘If you have the ability to make yourselves unknown, you better do it. And it should not matter to you if the people do not praise you, and it should not matter to you either that you are condemned by the people whilst you are being Praised in the Presence of Allah (azwj). Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) used to say: ‘There is no good in the world except for one of the two men – a man who increases in it the good deeds every day and a man who corrects himself, ready to face death by the repentance. But, what is meant by the repentance? By Allah (azwj)! If he were to perform prostrations to the extent that his neck breaks off, Allah (azwj) will not Accept deeds from him except by our (asws) Wilayah, the People (asws) of the Household. Indeed, (Acceptance) is for the ones who recognise our (asws) rights and hope for Reward by us (asws), (they) are pleased with their strength of half a ‘Mudd’ (Unit of measurement) of food every day, not being able to cover their private parts (insufficient clothing), and no covering over their head (roof), but still they are very much fearful of Allah (azwj) and are pleased with the (little) share from the world. And that is how Allah (azwj) has Described them where He (azwj) has Said: “[23:60] And those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear”. That’s what they come with? By Allah (azwj)! They come with obedience along with the love, and the Wilayah, and they are with regards to that, (but they are still) fearful that it may not be Accepted from them. By Allah (azwj), they are not fearful with the fear of doubt with regards to what they are in from the difficulties of Religion, but they are fearful that they might have been deficient (Muqassir) in our (asws) love and being (less) obedient to us (asws)’. Then said: ‘If you could afford not to go out of your houses, then do so, as when you go out then it becomes obligatory on you that you would not backbite, and not lie, and not be envious, and not show-off, and not pretend, and not flatter’. Then said: ‘Yes, a silo for the Muslim is his house in which he restrains his vision, and his tongue, and his self, and his genitals. The one, who recognises the Favours of Allah (azwj) by his heart, obligates more for himself from Allah (azwj), before he even expresses his appreciation for it upon his tongue, and the one who goes around considering himself to be better than others, so he is from the arrogant ones’. So I said to him (asws), ‘But what if he sees himself as better due to the (spiritual) health when he sees the one who is indulging in the sins?’ He (asws) said: ‘Far be it! Far be it! It may be that he has been Forgiven for his sins whilst you have been Paused for the Accounting. Have you not recited the story of the magicians (at the time) of Musa (as)?’ Then said: ‘How many are proud with what Allah (azwj) has Favoured them with, and how many have been enticed by the Veil of Allah (azwj) upon them, and how many have been infatuated by the praises of the people upon him’. Then said: ‘I (asws) hope for the salvation for the ones who recognise our (asws) rights, from this community except for one of the three – an unjust ruler, a follower of desires, an openly immoral one’. Then he (asws) recited: “[3:31] Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you”, then said: ‘O Hafs, the love is higher than the fear’. Then said: ‘By Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) does not Love the one who loves the world, and takes as a friend other than us (asws), whilst the one who recognises our (asws) rights and loves us (asws), so he has loved Allah (azwj)’. A man wept, so he (asws) said: ‘Are you crying? Even if the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, all of them get together crying to Allah (azwj) to be Rescued from the Fire and to be entered into the Paradise, they would not be able to intercede for you. Then if you had for yourself a living heart you would be the most fearful of the people to Allah (azwj) in that condition’. Then said to him: ‘O Hafs, be a follower and not a leader. O Hafs, the Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) said: ‘The one who fears Allah (azwj), would be of little speech’. Then said: ‘Once Musa Bin Imran (as) was advising his (as) companions, when a man stood up, and tore his shirt. So Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (as): “O Musa (as)! Say to him, ‘Do not tear your shirt, but open for Me (azwj) your heart’”. Then said: ‘Musa (as) Bin Imran (as) passed by a man from his (as) companion, and he was prostrating. So after return back from what he (as) had to do, (Musa (as)) saw him still in prostration. So Musa (as) said to him: ‘If (the fulfilment) of your need was in my (as) hands, I (asws) would have fulfilled it for you’. So Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (as); “O Musa (as)! Even if he were to prostrate until his neck breaks, I (azwj) will not Accept it until he turns away from what I (azwj) Abhor and towards what I (azwj) Love”.’",

So I looked at him (asws), so he (asws) called me over to eat with him (asws).

But, I (asws) am not saying that he (saww) could not find it, for he (saww) used to gift one man a hundred camels. Had he (saww) intended to eat it he (saww) would have eaten. And Jibraeel had come to him (saww) with the Keys of the treasures of the earth three times giving him (saww) the option without any reduction of anything from Allah (azwj) from what Allah (azwj) had Prepared for him (saww) for the Day of Judgement. He (saww) chose the modesty to his (saww) Lord (azwj). And when asked for anything he (saww) never said, ‘No’, at all. He (saww) would say: ‘If I (saww) had it I (saww) would give it’. And if was not available, he (saww) would say: ‘It would come’, and whenever Allah (azwj) Gave anything at all he (saww) would hand it over to him, to the extent that if the man has been Given the Paradise, which Allah (azwj) would submit to him (saww), then he (saww) would give it to him by his (saww) own hands’.

So he (Jibraeel) said: ‘These are the Keys of the treasures of the world which your (saww) Lord (azwj) has Sent to you (saww) so that there will be for you all that is carried by the earth without any reduction of anything’. The Rasool (saww) Allah (azwj) said: ‘I (saww) (want to be) among the friends of the Most High (azwj)’.",

No, but I (saww) would like to satiate one day and remain hungry one day, for if I (saww) am satiated I (saww) would thank You (azwj), and if I (saww) am hungry, I (saww) would supplicate to You (azwj) and Remember You (azwj)’.",

        "englishText": "103. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ali Bin Asbaat, who has narrated the following: The Imam (asws) having said: ‘Among the Advice which Allah (azwj) Gave to Isa (as) was: “O Isa (as)! I (azwj) am your (as) Lord (azwj), and the Lord (azwj) of your (as) forefathers. My (azwj) Name is ‘وَاحِدٌ’ the One, and I (azwj) am the ‘الْأَحَدُ’ the One, which cannot be divided, the Lone One Who (azwj) Created everything, and everything is Made by My (azwj) and everything Returns to Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! You (as) are the Messiah by My (azwj) Command, and you (as) create from the clay something like the bird (but) by My (azwj) Permission, and you (as) revive the dead by My (azwj) Speech, so become attentive towards Me (azwj) and be a ‘رَاهِباً’ fully devote yourself to Me (azwj), and you (as) will never find a refuge except with Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! I (azwj) Bequeath to you (as) a Compassionate Command with the Mercy until the Wilayah is Ordained from Me (azwj) and there comes Pleasure from Me (azwj). You (as) are blessed as a grown up and blessed as a child whereby you (as) testified that you (as) are My (azwj) servant, the son (as) of My (azwj) maidservant (Maryam (as)). Make room for Me (azwj) in yourself (as) like your (as) concerns, and make My (azwj) Remembrance to be for your (as) return, and come near to Me (azwj) by the optional (Prayers), and place reliance upon Me (azwj) for I (azwj) will Suffice for you (as), and do not rely upon the others for I (azwj) shall Abandon you (as). O Isa (as)! Observe patience upon the afflictions and be pleased with the Destiny, and become like My (azwj) Happiness in you (as), for if My (azwj) Happiness is what makes you (as) happy, you (as) will be obedient and will not disobey. O Isa (as)! Revive My (azwj) Remembrance by your (as) tongue, and make My (azwj) cordiality to be in your (as) heart. O Isa (as)! Be vigilant in the hours of neglect and consider Me (azwj) of Kind Wisdom. O Isa (as)! Be attentive, a Devotee, and prepare your (as) heart to fear (Me (azwj)). O Isa (as)! Be a shepherd of the night to search for My (azwj) Happiness, and Magnify Me (azwj) in your (as) daytime for asking for your (as) need from Me (saww). O Isa (as)! Compete with regards to the good with your (as) striving; you (as) will be known by the good wherever you (as) may turn to. O Isa (as)! Judge among My (azwj) servants by My (azwj) Advice, and stand among them with My (azwj) Justice, for I (azwj) have Made to Descend upon you (as) a healing for what is in the chests from the diseases of the Satan (la). O Isa (as)! Do not be seated with the intrigued (hypocrites). O Isa (as)! Truly I (azwj) Say that no creature believed in Me (azwj) except that he was humble to Me (azwj), and did not humble himself to Me (azwj) except that he hoped for My (azwj) Reward. Be a witness that he is safe from My (azwj) Punishment, (that will be) the one who did not change or replace My (azwj) Sunnah. O Isa (as), the first son (as) of the chaste virgin, weep for your (as) self with a weeping like the one who says farewell to his family, and hate the world and leave it to its people, and become interested in what is in the Presence of your (as) God. O Isa (as)! Be along with that as a soft-spoken person, and offers greetings and be vigilant when the eyes of the righteous go to sleep. Be cautious of the Return and the severe earthquakes and the sensations of the Day of Judgement when neither the family, not the sons, nor the wealth would be of any benefit. O Isa (as)! Apply the Kohl of grief in your (as) eyes whilst the people of falsehood laugh. O Isa (as)! Become humble and patient, for Tooba is for you (as) if you (as) achieve what has been Prepared for the patient ones. O Isa (as)! Go from the world day by day, and taste the food from which its taste is less indulging. So I (azwj) Truly Say, you (as) are not with anything except for your (as) hour and your (as) day, so go from the world with provision, and let the rough (clothes) and less tempting (food) suffice for you (as) for you (as) have seen what becomes of it, and whatever you (as) take is written down, and how you (as) have consumed it. O Isa (as)! You (as) will be questioned, so be merciful to the weak just like My (azwj) Mercy towards you (as), and do not subdue the orphan. O Isa (as)! You (as) weep over yourself (as) in private, move your (as) feet to the timings of the Prayer, and let Me (azwj) Hear your (as) sweet speech of My (azwj) remembrance, for My (azwj) Favour to you (as) is good. O Isa (as)! How many from the community I (azwj) have Destroyed for their previous sins which I (azwj) have Protected you (as) from it. O Isa (as)! Be kind to the weak ones and raise your tired eye towards the sky and call upon Me (azwj) for I (azwj) am Near to you (as) and do not Pray to Me (azwj) except by Supplicating to Me (azwj) for your (as) concern is one concern, for when you (as) call upon Me (azwj) in such a manner, I (azwj) will Answer you (as). O Isa (as), I (azwj) was not Pleased with Presenting the world as a Reward for the ones who were before you (as), nor as a Punishment for the ones I (azwj) Want to Retaliate against. O Isa (as)! You (as) are to die and I (azwj) shall Remain, and from Me (azwj) is your (as) sustenance, and with Me (azwj) is your (as) fixed term and to Me (azwj) is your (as) eventual return, and to Me (azwj) is your (as) Accounting, so ask Me (azwj) and do not ask someone else, for the best from you (as) is the supplication, and from Me (azwj) is the Answering of it. O Isa (as)! How numerous are the human beings and how little are, in numbers, the patient ones. The trees are many but the good ones of it are few. So do not be deceived by the beauty of the tree until you have tasted its fruit. O Isa (as)! Do not be deceived by the rebellious one by disobeying My (Commands), I (azwj) Provide sustenance so (don’t) worship someone else, then he calls upon Me (azwj) during hardships, so I (azwj) Answer him. Then he returns to what he used to be in, rebelling against Me (azwj) exposing himself to My (azwj) Anger. I (azwj) Swear by Myself (azwj) that I (azwj) shall Grab him with such a Grip that there will be no salvation for him from it, and no refuge apart from Me (azwj). Where will he run from My (azwj) skies and from My (azwj) earth? O Isa (as)! Say to the unjust ones from the Children of Israel not to supplicate to Me (azwj) whilst the illegal earnings is under their hearts (into their stomach), and the idols are in their houses, for I (azwj) have Undertaken that I (azwj) shall Answer to the one who supplicates to Me (azwj), and Make My (azwj) Answer to be a Curse upon them (who disobey) until they disperse. O Isa (as)! How many times have I (azwj) Given them lengthy Consideration, and goodness of the seeking, but the people are in neglect and they will not return. The words come out from their mouths but their hearts are not with it. They expose themselves to My (azwj) Abhorrence and seek nearness to the Believers by display their love for Me (azwj) (showing hypocrisy) O Isa (as)! Make your (as) tongue to be one, be it in secret or in the open, and do that similarly with your (as) heart and your (as) vision. And turn your (as) heart and your (as) vision away from the Prohibited and restrain your (as) vision from that which has no benefit. So how many glances of the looker have planted lust in his heart, and returned him by it to the fountains of destruction. O Isa (as)! Be merciful and compassionate, and be as you (as) would like the people to be towards you (as). And frequently remember the death, and the separation of the families. And do not play for its amusements (as it) spoils the player. And do not be neglectful one for the neglectful is far from Me (azwj). And Remember Me (azwj) by the righteous deeds so that I (azwj) speak of you (as). O Isa (as)! Repent and return to Me (azwj) after the sins, and Mention Me (azwj) by the penitence, and believe in Me (azwj), and come closer to the Believers by Me (azwj), and urge them to supplicate to me (azwj) along with you (as). And beware of the supplication of the oppressed for I (azwj) have Undertaken upon Myself (azwj) that I (azwj) shall Open for it the Doors of the sky by the Acceptance, and Answer him even though it may be after a while. O Isa (as)! Know that the evil one infects, and the evil friend destroys. And know the one whom you (as) befriend and chose as a brother for yourself (as) from the Believers. O Isa (as)! Repent to Me (azwj) as there is no grand sin that I (azwj) do not Forgive it, and I (azwj) am the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Work for yourself (as) in the time allocated from your (as) term before someone else works for it, and worship Me (azwj) for a day which will be like a thousand years of your counting, during which I (azwj) will Reward the good deeds by increasing them, and that the sins would remain with their doers. Prepare for yourself (as) in the allocated time, and compete in the good deeds, for how many a gathering has dispersed and its people being each other’s neighbours in the Fire. O Isa (as)! Abstain with regards to the mortal, that which will be cut-off, of the houses of the ones who were before you (as), so call them and whisper to them. Do you (as) feel that any one of them would take your (as) advice? And know, that you (as) will be joining them among the joining ones’. O Isa (as)! Say to the one who has rebelled against Me (azwj) by disobedience and works in opposition, to expect My (azwj) Punishment and await My (azwj) Destruction upon him, so he will be joined with the Destroyed ones. Tooba is for you (as), O son (as) of Maryam (as). Then Tooba is for you (as) if you (as) were to take to the discipline of your (as) God Who is Compassionate towards you (as) and Merciful, and Begin with the Favours to you (as) from Him (azwj) for Honour, as He (azwj) was for you (as) in the difficulties, and you (as) did not disobey Him (azwj). O Isa (as)! It is not Permissible for you (as) to disobey Him (azwj) Who has Advised you (asws) just as He (azwj) had Advised the ones who were before you (as), and I (azwj) am a Witness over that. O Isa (as)! I (azwj) have not Honoured any creature with the like of My (azwj) Religion, nor a Favour to him like My (azwj) Mercy. O Isa (as)! Wash with the water from you, what is apparent and heal with the goodness from you (as) what is hidden, for you (as) will be returning to Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! I (azwj) Gave to you (as) what I (azwj) had Favoured you (as) with an uninterrupted flow, and Sought from you (as) a loan for yourself (as), so if you (as) were to be niggardly with regards to it you (as) would become of the Destroyed ones. O Isa (as)! Adorn yourself (as) with the Religion and love the poor, and walk upon the earth in humility, and Pray upon the remainder, for all of it is clean. O Isa (as)! Roll up (your (as) affairs) for all that comes, is close by, and read My (azwj) Book whilst you (as) are clean, make Me (azwj) Listen to a voice from you (as) full of grief. O Isa (as)! There is no good in enjoyment which does not last and the life of the enjoyer is in decline. O son (as) of Maryam (as)! If you (as) were to see what I (azwj) have Prepared for My (azwj) righteous friends, your (as) heart would melt, and your (as) soul would come out (of your (as) body) in desire for it. So there is no house like the House of the Hereafter in which the neighbours are good people, and the Angels of Proximity come up to them, and they would be from the ones who would come on the Day of Judgement being safe from its horrors. A House in which, there is no change in the Bliss, nor are its inhabitants in decline. O son (as) of Maryam (as)! Compete with regards to it (the House in the Hereafter) along with the competitors, for it is the desire of the desirous ones, of good scenery. Tooba is for you, O son (as) of Maryam (as) , if you (as) are from the workers for it, along with your (as) forefathers Adam (as), and Ibrahim (as), being in the Gardens and Bliss, not seeking a substitution for it nor a transfer from it. That is how I (azwj) Deal with the pious ones. O Isa (as)! Flee to Me (azwj) like those who flee from the flaming Fire, and the Fire with chains and fetters. No soul would enter it and its grief would leave from him ever. It is a part like the part of the dark night. Those who are rescued from it would be successful, and those who do not get Rescued from it would be of the Destroyed ones. This is the House of the tyrants, and hardened oppressors, and every harsh, rude one, and every arrogant boaster. O Isa (as)! It is the evil house for the ones in its corner, and the evil dwelling for the unjust ones. I (azwj) Caution you (as), so that you (as) would be informed about it. O Isa (as)! Beware you (as) can be an observer for Me (azwj), and testify that I (azwj) have Created you (as), and you (as) are My (azwj) servant, and I (azwj) Shaped you (as), and sent you (as) down to the earth. O Isa (as)! It is not correct for two tongues to be in one mouth, not for two hearts to be in one chest, similarly for the minds. O Isa (as)! Do not wake up as a disobedient one, nor indulge in vanities whilst awake, and turn yourself (as) away from the lusts and the sins, and every desire which distances you (as) from Me (azwj). So migrate from it, and know that you (as) are from Me (azwj) at the status of the trustworthy Rasool (as), so be cautious with regards to Me (azwj), and know that your (as) world will deliver you (as) to Me (azwj), and I (azwj) will Grab you (as) with My (azwj) Knowledge. So become a humble soul during My (azwj) Remembrance, with a revering heart when you (as) Mention Me (azwj), being fully aware whilst the neglectful ones sleep. O Isa (as)! This is My (azwj) Advice to you (as) and My (azwj) Preaching to you (as), so take it from Me (azwj), and I (azwj) am the Lord (azwj) of the worlds. O Isa (as)! If My (azwj) servant is patient with Me (azwj), his Rewards for his deeds are upon Me (azwj), and it was upon him to supplicate to Me (azwj), and I (azwj) am Sufficient to Take Revenge from the ones who are disobedient to Me (azwj). Where will the unjust runaway to, from Me (azwj)? O Isa (as)! Speak good words wherever you (as) may be, for I (azwj) am a Knowledgeable Teacher. O Isa (as)! Bestow the good deeds towards Me (azwj) until it is Mentioned in My (azwj) Presence, and take to My (azwj) Advice, for there is a healing for the hearts therein. O Isa (as)! Do not hesitate when you (as) plan from My (azwj) Plan, and do not forget My (azwj) Remembrance in the privacy of the world. O Isa (as)! Take account of yourself (as) by referring to Me (azwj) until I (azwj) Accomplish the Rewards for what the workers have worked for. Those are the ones who will be getting their Recompense, and I (azwj) am the Best of the Givers. O Isa (as)! You (as) were Created by My (azwj) Word, and Maryam (as) gave birth to you (as) by My (azwj) Command, the Message sent to her (as) by My (azwj) Spirit Jibraeel the Trustworthy one from My (azwj) Angels, until you (as) stood upon the earth alive and walking. All that had been encompassed by My (azwj) Knowledge. O Isa (as)! Zakariyya (as) is at the status of your (as) father, and is the guardian of your (as) mother (as). When he (as) came up to her (as) in the Niche (Al-Mihraab) he (as) found sustenance in her (as) presence. And your (as) counterpart Yahya (as) (John) is from My (azwj) creatures, and I (azwj) Gifted him (as) to his (as) mother after the old age had set in, and she had no strength to her. I (azwj) Intended by that to Display to her My (azwj) Authority, and Display with regards to you (as), My (azwj) Power. The most Beloved of you all, to Me (azwj) is the one who is most obedient to Me (azwj), and the most intense in his fear from Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! Be vigilant and do not despair from My (azwj) Spirit, and Glorify Me (azwj) along with the ones who Glorify Me (azwj), and with the good speech Extol My (azwj) Holiness. O Isa (as)! How can the servants disbelieve in Me (azwj) whilst their forelocks are in My (azwj) Grip, and their going about in My (azwj) land while being ignorant of My (azwj) Favours, and their befriending of My (azwj) enemies, and that is how the infidels are (destined for) Destruction. O Isa (as)! The world is a prison with the rotten smell, and there is beauty in it from what has been seen by the tyrants who slaughter each other for it. And beware of the world, for every bounty of it is subject to decline, and there is no bounty in it except for a little. O Isa (as)! Reach for Me (azwj) near your (as) pillow and you (as) will find Me (azwj), and call upon Me (azwj) and you (as) are Beloved unto Me (azwj), for I (azwj) am the most Hearing of the listening. I (azwj) shall Answer the supplicant when one supplicates to Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! Fear Me (azwj) and get My (azwj) servants to fear Me (azwj) perhaps the sinners would abstain from what they are working in, so no one would be destroyed except that they would be aware (of it). O Isa (as)! Be in awe of Me (azwj) as you (as) are awed by the (fearful) beasts, and the death which you (as) are going to meet up with, for all these things, I (azwj) Created them, so it is Me (azwj) they should be Awed of. O Isa (as)! The Kingdom is Mine (azwj) and in My (azwj) Hands, and I (azwj) am the King, so if you (as) were to obey Me (azwj), I (azwj) shall Make you (as) to Enter My (azwj) Paradise among the neighbourhood of the righteous ones. O Isa (as)! If I (azwj) am Angry with you (as), the happiness of those who are happy with you (as) would be of no benefit to you (as), and if I (azwj) am Pleased with you (as), the anger of the angry ones would not adversely affect you (as). O Isa (as)! Remember me (azwj) in your (as) soul, I (azwj) will Remember you (as) Myself (azwj), and Mention Me (azwj) among your (as) people and I (azwj) will Mention you (as) among My (azwj) Gathering which is better than the gathering of the human beings. O Isa (as)! Supplicate to Me (azwj) by the supplication of the drowning one (Al-Ghareek), the grieving one for whom there is no helper (except Me (azwj)). O Isa (as)! Do not swear falsely by Me (azwj), for (that) My (azwj) Throne Trembles in Anger. The world has a short life span, but there are long yearnings therein, whilst in My (azwj) Possession is a better House from what you (as) accumulate. O Isa (as)! How will you (as) react when I (azwj) Bring out a Book for you (as) which Speaks with the Truth, and you will all testify to the secrets that you have been concealing, and the deeds which you had been performing. O Isa (as)! Say to the unjust ones of the Children of Israel: ‘You have washed your faces, and left your hearts as filthy. Are you trying to deceive Me (azwj) with a deception, or are you being audacious against Me (azwj)? You are applying fragrance for the people of the world whilst your inner selves are in My (azwj) Presence at the status of the rotten carcass, as if you are a dead people’. O Isa (as)! Say to them: ‘Trim your fingernails (cut yourselves off) from unlawful gains, and deafen your ears from the indecent speech, and turn towards Me (azwj) by your hearts, for I (azwj) do not Want (Fond of) your appearances. O Isa (as)! Be happy with the good deeds for therein lies My (azwj) Pleasure, and weep over the sins for it is a disgrace. And do not carry forward to others what you (as) do not like them to do unto you (as), and if your (as) right cheek is slapped then give him the left one. And come closer to Me (azwj) by the cordiality and your (as) striving, and keep away from the ignorant ones. O Isa (as)! Be humble to the people of good deeds and participate with them in it, and be a witness upon them and say to the unjust ones of the Children of Israel: ‘O evil companions who are seated upon it, if you do not desist, I (azwj) will metamorphose you into monkeys and pigs. O Isa (as)! Say to the unjust ones of the Children of Israel: ‘The Wisdom weeps after being made to separate from Me (azwj), and you are laughing by fleeing away from me. Has there come to you My (azwj) Disavowing, or have you found security from My (azwj) Punishment, or are you exposing yourselves to My (azwj) Punishment? I (azwj) Swear by Myself (azwj) that I (azwj) will Abandon you to be an example for the coming generations to learn a lesson from. Then I (azwj) Advise you (as), O son (as) of Maryam (as) the chaste virgin, of the (coming of) the Chief of the Rasools (as), and My (azwj) Beloved, so he (saww) is Ahmad (saww), the owner of the red camel, with a face illuminated with the light as bright as the full moon, and the one pure of the heart, and intensely valiant, the prestigious, for he (saww) is the Mercy to the Worlds, and the Chief of the children of Adam (as) on the Day that he (saww) will meet Me (azwj). The most honourable of the former ones to Me (azwj), and the nearest one to Me (azwj) from the Rasools (as), the Arab, the trustworthy, the embodiment of My (azwj) Religion, the patient one in struggling against the Polytheists by his (saww) own self and hands for the sake of My (azwj) Religion. And inform the Children of Israel about him (saww), and command them that they should ratify him (saww), and believe in him (saww), and follow him (saww), and help him (saww)”. Isa (as) said: ‘My (as) God! Who is he (saww) that if I (as) were to please him (saww) it would Please You (azwj)?’ He (azwj) Said: “He (saww) is Muhammad (saww), the Rasool Allah (saww) to all of the people. He (saww) is the closest to Me (azwj) in status, and the presenter for the intercession. Tooba is for him (saww) from the Prophets (as) and Tooba for his (saww) community who will meet Me (azwj) whilst being upon his (saww) way. The inhabitants of the earth praise him (saww), and the inhabitants of the sky seek Forgiveness through him (saww). The trustworthy, the Entrusted one, the good, the blessed, the best of the remaining ones in My (azwj) Presence who will be in the end of times. When he (saww) comes out, the sky will loosen its rainfall and the earth will bring out its blossoms until they will see the Blessings, and I (azwj) will Bless for him (saww) whatever that he (saww) places his (saww) hand upon, one with many wives and few children. He (saww) will live at Bekka (Makkah), the place of foundation of Ibrahim (as). O Isa (as)! his (saww) Religion is the upright one (Al-Haneefa), and his (saww) direction (Qiblah) is the Right one, and he (saww) is from My (azwj) Party, and I (azwj) am with him (saww). So Tooba is for him (saww). Then again Tooba is for him (saww), for him (saww) is Al-Kawsar, and the great status in Gardens of Eden, living honourably, the ones that live in it, and he (saww) will pass away as a martyr. For him (saww) is the Fountain greater than from Bakka (Makkah) up to the rising of the sun. In this are springs of a sealed drink (Al-Raheeq Al-Makhtoum) similar (in number) to the stars in the sky, and cups similar (in number) to the grains of the sands of the earth, sweetened in it from every drink and food of every fruit in the Paradise. The one, who drinks from it a drink, will never be thirsty ever again, and that is what I (azwj) have Apportioned for him (saww), and as a merit for him (saww) over the period in between you (as) and him (saww). His (saww) secret would be in accordance with his publicising, and his (saww) words would be his (saww) deeds. He (saww) will not command the people except by himself (saww) doing it first. His (saww) Religion is the Holy War in hardship as well as in ease. The cities would surrender to him (saww) and the ruler of Rome would yield to him (saww). He (saww) would be upon the Religion of Ibrahim (as). He (saww) will mention My (saww) name during partaking of the food, and would express the greetings, and he (saww) will Pray whilst the people are sleeping. Every day he (saww) would Pray five Prayers calling out in sequence to the Prayer like the calling of the army by the slogan. And he (saww) would open by the exclamation of the Takbeer, and he (saww) would end by the greetings. He (saww) would keep his (saww) feet in a row during the Prayer just as the Angels keep their feet in a row. And he (saww) would humble his (saww) heart before Me (azwj), as well as his (saww) head. The ‘النُّورُ ’( the Divine Light) would be in his (saww) chest, and the truth would be upon his (saww) tongue, and he (saww) would be on the truth wherever he (saww) may be. His (saww) origin would be as an orphan wandering for a while during his (saww) time for that which is required from him (saww). His (saww) eyes would sleep but his (saww) heart would never sleep. For him (saww) is the intercession, and upon his (saww) community the Hour would be Established (Day of Judgement be made easy). And My (azwj) Hand is Above their hands, so the one who breaks (the Covenant) so he would have broken it against himself. And the one who is loyal to what has been Covenanted with him, I (azwj) would be Loyal to him with the Paradise. So command the unjust ones of the Children of Israel to study his (saww) Books and not to alter his (saww) Sunnah, and that they should send the greetings upon him (saww) for he (saww) is upon the status more glorious than the glorious. O Isa (as)! All that which brings you (as) closer to Me (azwj), I (azwj) have Evidenced it for you (as), and everything which distances you (as) from Me (azwj), so I (azwj) have Prohibited you (as) from it, so refer to it for yourself (as). O Isa (as)! The world is sweet, and I have Utilised you (as) in it, so stay aside from what I (azwj) have Cautioned you (as) from, and take from it what I (azwj) Give to you (as) as a Gift. O Isa (as)! Look into your (as) affairs with a consideration of the sinful servant, the erroneous one, and do not look into the affairs of the other with the position of the Lord (azwj). Become an ascetic therein and do not be allured with regards to it, for you (as) would be corrupted. O Isa (as)!

O Isa (as)!

O Isa (as)! Perfume your (as) heart for Me (azwj) and frequent My (azwj) Remembrance in the privacy, and know that My (azwj) Happiness is in your (as) pleading to Me (azwj), so be alive during that and not become as dead (heart). O Isa (as)! Do not associate anything with Me (azwj) and be cautious from Me (azwj), and do not be deceived by the (good) health and do not be envious for the world is like a fleeting shadow, and what approaches it is like what has been left behind from it. So compete in the righteous deeds with your (as) striving, and be with the truth wherever it may be even though you (as) may be cut and burnt by the fire. So do not disbelieve in Me (azwj) after the understanding, and do not become of the ignorant ones, for one ends up with that to which one associates. O Isa (as)! Pour out your (as) tears for Me (azwj) from your (as) eyes, and humble your (as) heart to Me (azwj). O Isa (as)! Cry out to Me (azwj) for help during difficult conditions, for I (azwj) Help the afflicted ones and I (azwj) Answer the restless, and I (azwj) the most Merciful of the merciful ones”.",

Then the water prided itself and overflowed and said, ‘Which thing can overcome me?’ So He (azwj) Created the wind which moved its waves and raised what was in its bottom, and restrained it from its direction, and so the water became submissive. Then the wind prided itself, raged and loosened its tails and said, ‘Which thing can overcome me?’ So He (azwj) Created the human being who built shelters and tricked the wind by veiling himself from it and other, so the wind became humble. Then the human being rebelled and said, ‘Who is stronger than me?’ So He (azwj) Created the death for him, which defeated him, and so he became submissive. Then the death prided itself so Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “Do not be proud, for I (azwj) will Slaughter you in between the two sects – the people of the Paradise and the people of the Fire, then I (azwj) will not Revive you ever, whether you return (repent) or you fear”. And he (asws) also said: ‘And the forbearance overcomes the anger, and the mercy overcomes the harshness, and the charity overcomes the sins’. Then Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘There is more like this where one thing overcomes the other’.",

He (asws) said: ‘Ali (asws) used to fetch the water and the firewood, and Fatima (asws) used to grind, and knead, and bake, and stitch. She (asws) was of the most beautiful of face from the people, with cheeks like two roses, may Greetings be upon her (asws), and upon her (asws) father (saww), and her (asws) husband (asws), and her (asws) purified children (asws)’.",

Ali Bin Al-Husayn Al-Mozab, and someone else, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Khalid, from Ismail Bin Mahraan, from Abdullah Bin Abu Al-Haris Al-Hamdany, from Jabir, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) says that Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon saying: ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj), the Abaser, the Raiser, the Harmer, the Benefitter, the vastly Benevolent, Majestic is His (azwj) Praise, True are His (azwj) Names, Overwhelming by the Hidden and what approaches the hearts, the One Who (azwj) Made the death to be in the midst of His (azwj) creatures with Justice, and Favoured them with the life. So He (azwj) Bestows life and Brings upon death and Measures out the sustenance by His (azwj) Knowledge by an Estimation, and Mastered by His (azwj) Wisdom the measure of it. He (azwj) is All-Aware, All-Seeing. He (azwj) is Eternal without cessation, and the Remaining without an end. He (azwj) Knows what is in the earth, and what is in the Heaven, and what lies between the two and what is (covered) underneath the soil. I (asws) Praise Him (azwj) sincerely with the treasured Praise, by what the Angels and the Prophets (as) Praised Him (azwj). A Praise which cannot be numbered, nor can time pass it by, and no one has even come with the like of it. I (asws) believe in Him (azwj) and place reliance upon Him (azwj), and Guided by Him (azwj), Sufficed by Him (azwj), and Judged by Him (azwj) with good, and by His (azwj) Pleasure. And I (asws) testify that there is no god except Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), and I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant and His (azwj) Messenger (saww) having Sent with the Guidance and the Religion of the Truth to Make it overcome all of the other Religions even though the Polytheists may be averse to it. May greetings be upon him (saww) and his (saww) Progeny (asws)’. O you people! The world is not a house for you to settle in, but rather you are in it like passengers of a caravan, which have been asked to move on soon after being disembarked. They came to it lightly (without luggage) and would be exiting from it lightly (with empty hands), not finding a way to divert from the journey, or a way to return to what they had left behind. Take them seriously, for they relied upon the world and did not prepare until they were taken by the throat, and their conclusion was that they ended-up in a house of people for whom the pens have dried up (nothing to be written anymore for them). There remains neither any news for most of them nor any traces of them. They were in the world only for a little while and were dispatched to the Hereafter in a hurry. So you have become residents in their houses, following in their footsteps like a herd of animals travelling on a journey in which there is neither ‘Where’ (are we going?) and no ‘How far’ (are we going?). Your days are tiring upon yourselves and your nights are an escape for your souls. So in the morning your condition is what their condition used to be and you just follow their ways as examples. So do not let the life of the world deceive you, for you are only travelers in it. Death would descend among you and shoot its arrows, and herd you all to the House of the Reward, and the Punishment, and the Recompense, and the Accounting’. May Allah (azwj) have Mercy upon the person who is concerned about his Lord (azwj) and moved away from his sins, and (likes to) argue against his own desires and rejects his own yearnings. A person who harnessed himself with the reins of piety for fearing for the Sake of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, led to His (azwj) obedience by its reins, raising his head towards the Return with his eyes expecting the approach of death at all times, permanently thinking about it with a prolonged vigilance, abstaining from the world, earnestly working for the Hereafter. A person who has made the patience to be his ride to salvation, and the piety as his preparation for his death and as a medication for his (spiritual) illness. He learned a lesson, and considered, and left the world and the people. He learnt it for understanding and steadfastness, and his heart had respected the remembrance of the Return. He folded up his mattress, separated himself from his pillow, stood up on his feet and entered in its surroundings, fearful for the Sake of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, displaying humbleness between his face and the two palms in secret to his Lord (azwj) shedding tears and making his heart as a strong enclave in a prolonged fear of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. His interest is great regarding what is in the possession of Allah (azwj) whilst his fear for Pleasing Him (azwj) is intense. He suffices himself with the subsistence for his affairs and displays other than what he conceals, being content with the minimum from what he knows. These are the trusted ones of Allah (azwj) in His (azwj) land, by whom He (azwj) Defends His (azwj) servants. If one of them were to swear upon Allah (azwj) Majestic is His (azwj) Mention, he would fulfill it, or if he were to supplicate against anyone, Allah (azwj) would Help him. He (azwj) Listens to him when he whispers to Him (azwj) and Answers Him (azwj) when he calls upon Him (azwj). Allah (azwj) has Made the Good Ending to be for the pious and the Paradise for its deserving ones. “[10:10] Their cry in it shall be the best of the calls Glory to Thee, O Allah! Their calling out to the Master (azwj) for what He (azwj) would have Bestowed upon them, and their greeting in it shall be: Peace; and the last of their cry shall be: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds”.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Al-No’man, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) mentioned this sermon of Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) on the day of Friday : - ‘All Praise is for Allah (azwj) Who (azwj) is Deserving of all Praise and is the Guardian of it, and all Praise ends to Him (azwj) in its rightful place, the Initiator, and Inventor, the Majestic, the Magnificent, the Mighty, the Benevolent, the only One for the Greatness, and the Unique One for the Highness, the Omnipotent with Esteem, and the Overcomer by His (azwj) Omnipotence, the Preventer by His (azwj) Force, the Dominant by His (azwj) Power, Higher than everything by His (azwj) Compulsiveness, the Praised One by His (azwj) Gratitude and by His (azwj) Favours, the Provider by His (azwj) Gifts, and excessive Benefits, the Expansive in His (azwj) Sustenance, the Bestower by His (azwj) Bounties. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Bounties and apparent Blessings, with a Praise weighed by His (azwj) Greatness and His (azwj) Majesty, and filled by His (azwj) Blessings and Greatness. And I (asws) testify that there is no god except for Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), Who (azwj) was in His (azwj) Existence as Foremost and in His (azwj) Everlasting. Veiled from the creatures was His (azwj) Oneness, and His (azwj) Lordship, and His (azwj) being Eternal, and they were submitted to the continuance of time. And I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant, and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and His (azwj) elite from His (azwj) creatures having Chosen him (saww) with His (azwj) Knowledge and Selected him (saww) for His (azwj) Revelation, and Relied upon him (saww) for His (azwj) Secret, and was Pleased with him (saww) for His (azwj) creatures, Assigned him (saww) for His (azwj) Great Command as a beacon for the Principles of His (azwj) Religion and a Program for His (azwj) Way, and an Opener for His (azwj) Revelation, as a Reason for the Door of His (azwj) Mercy. He (azwj) Sent him (saww) during a gap from the Messengers (as), and Guides from the Knowledge, and during fatigue from the differing and straying from the truth, and ignorance about the Lord (azwj), and denial of the Resurrection, and the Promise that He (azwj) Sent him (saww) to all the people as a Mercy to the Worlds by the Honourable Book which He (azwj) had Excelled it, and Detailed it, and Explained it, and Clarified it, and Strengthened it, and Preserved it from it being approached by the falsehood from its front and from its back. A Revelation from the Most Wise and Praised One (azwj). In it He (azwj) struck examples, and Gave therein Signs for the ones who have intellect. He (azwj) Permitted therein the Permissibles and Prohibited therein the Prohibitions, and Legalised therein the Religion for His (azwj) servants, Giving Excuses and Warnings so that they would become a Proof for the people to Allah (azwj) after the Messengers (as) and become a Preaching for a worshipping people. So he (saww) preached His (azwj) Message, and strived in His (azwj) Way, and worshipped Him (azwj) they were convinced. May Greetings of Allah (azwj) be upon him (saww) and his (saww) Progeny (asws), and submission to him (saww) be a lot of Peace. I (asws) advise you, O servants of Allah (azwj) to fear Allah (azwj) Who Began the affairs by His (azwj) Knowledge and to Him (azwj) is their journey tomorrow for its end. And in His (azwj) Hand is their extinction, and your extinction, and the expiration for your days, and the extermination of your allocated terms, and the cutting off of your terms. So, very shortly it would pass by you all just as it had left the ones who were before you all. Servants of Allah (azwj)! Make your striving in this world to provide from these short-lived days for the days of the Hereafter which are prolonged, for this is the house for the deeds and the Hereafter is the house for dwelling in, and the Recompense. So abandon it (the world), for deceived is the one who is deceived by its deception. Do not rely upon the world by attaching your hopes and become the ones who love it, the ones who covet it, the ones who are fascinated by it just like what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[10:24] The likeness of this world’s life is only as water which We send down from the cloud, then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby, until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed; produce, as though it had not been in existence yesterday; thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect”. Along with that, a person never got experience in this world except that he inherited a lesson from it, nor did he wake up in the morning feeling secure except that he feared in it the descent of a catastrophe, or a change in bounties or a decline in health, with the death right behind that, and the trepidation of the Pausing in front of the Wise and Just One (azwj) Recompensing every soul with what it had done “[53:31] that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness”. So fear Allah (azwj), Mighty is His (azwj) Mention, and hasten to the Pleasure of Allah (azwj), and the deeds with obedience to Him (azwj), and get closer to Him (azwj) with everything in which there is His (azwj) Pleasure for He (azwj) is Near and Answers. May Allah (azwj) Make us (asws) and you all of those who act towards His (azwj) Love and keep aside from His (azwj) Harshness. Then the best of the stories, and the best of the Advice, and the most beneficial of the Remembrance is the Book of Allah (azwj) Majestic and Mighty. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[7:204] And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be shown to you”. I (asws) seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the Satan (la) the castaway. In the Name of Allah (azwj) the Beneficent the Merciful “[103:1] I swear by the time, [103:2] Most surely man is in loss, [103:3] Except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other truth, and enjoin on each other patience”. “[33:56] Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation”. Our Allah (azwj)! Send Greetings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and Blessings upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and yearning upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad, and Peace upon Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww) higher than what You (azwj) had Greeted, and Blessed, and Mercy, and Yearning, and Peace upon Ibrahim (as) and the Progeny of Ibrahim (as), You (azwj) are the Most Praised and Most Glorious’. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the ‘الْوَسِيلَةَ’ Means, and the ‘الشَّرَفَ’ Dignity, and the ‘الْفَضِيلَةَ’ Preference, and the ‘الْمَنْزِلَةَ الْكَرِيمَةَ’ Honourable Status. Our Allah (azwj)! Make Muhammad (saww) and the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad to be the greatest of all creatures, all of them (asws) as Dignitaries on the Day of Judgement, the nearest to You (azwj) in seating, the most eminent of faces in Your (azwj) Presence on the Day of Judgement, the most prestigious and preferential in Your (azwj) Presence in status and share. Our Allah (azwj)! Grant to Muhammad (saww) the most Dignified of the status, and Bestow the Peace and intercession of Al-Islam. Our Allah (azwj)! And join us all with him (saww), without failure, or loss, or remorse or alteration. O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just! Amen!’ Then he (asws) sat down for a while, then stood up and said: ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) the One most deserving to be Awed and Praised, and the Foremost for the one who fears and worships, and the Highest for the one who Magnifies and Glorifies. We Praise Him (azwj) for His (azwj) Great Benevolence, and Excessive Grants, and apparent of His (azwj) Favours, and the goodness of His (azwj) Trials. And we believe in His (azwj) Guidance whose light does not get extinguished, nor does His (azwj) Extol be fully expressed, Whose Handle does not weaken. We seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from the evil of every doubt, and the darkness of the strife, and we seek Forgiveness from the accumulation of the sins, and seek Protection from Him (azwj) from the wickedness of the deeds, and the detestable hopes, and the attacks of the terrors, and association with the people of the doubt, and the happiness with what the immoral ones do in the earth without having any right to do so. Our Allah (azwj)! Forgive us, and the Believing men and the Believing women, the living ones among them and the dead who You (azwj) have Made to die upon Your (azwj) Religion, and the Nation of Your (azwj) Prophet (saww). Our Allah (azwj), Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Make Mercy to enter upon them, and the Forgiveness, and the Pleasure. And Forgive the living ones from the Believing men and the Believing women who believed in Your (azwj) Oneness, and ratified Your (azwj) Messenger (saww), and attached themselves to Your (azwj) Religion, and acted upon Your (azwj) Obligations, and followed Your (azwj) Prophet (saww), and made Your (azwj) Sunnah to be their Sunnah, and permitted for themselves Your (azwj) Permissibles, and Prohibited for themselves Your (azwj) Prohibitions, and feared Your (azwj) Punishment, and hoped for Your (azwj) Rewards, and befriended Your (azwj) friends, and were inimical to Your (azwj) enemies. Our Allah (azwj)! Accept their good deeds, and Overlook their sins, and Keep them, by Your (azwj) Mercy, with the righteous servants, O Lord (azwj) of the ‘الْحَقِّ’ Just. Amen!’",

        "englishText": "202. From him, from Ali Bin Al-Husayn, from Ali Bin Abu hamza, from Abu Baseer, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) regarding the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[58:7] Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wheresoever they are; then He will inform them of what they did on the day of resurrection: surely Allah is Cognizant of all things”. He (asws) said; ‘This was Revealed regarding so and so and so and so (Abu Bakr and Umar), and Abu Ubeyda Ibn Al-Jarrah, and Abdul Rahman Ibn Awf, and Saalim Mawla Abu Huzeyfa, and Al-Mugheira Bin Sho’ba, when they wrote the agreement in between them and took a pledge and agreed that if Muhammad (saww) were to pass away, they would not let the Caliphate to be in the Clan of Hashim, nor the Prophet-hood ever. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Revealed this Verse with regards to them. I said, ‘The Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[43:79] Or have they settled an affair? Then surely, We are the settlers. [43:80] Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal and their secret discourses? Indeed (We do), and Our messengers are by them, to record”. He (asws) said: ‘And these two Verse were Revealed regarding them on that day’. Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘Hopefully you will see that is was a day resembling the day of the writing of the agreement except for the day Al-Husayn (asws) was martyred, and thus it had preceded in the Knowledge of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic which He (azwj) Made known to the Rasool Allah (saww) that when the agreement is written down, Al-Husayn (asws) would be martyred, and the kingdom would exit from the Clan of Hashim. So all of that did take place. I said, ‘The Verse: “[49:9] And if two parties of the believers quarrel, make peace between them; but if one of them acts wrongfully towards the other, fight that which acts wrongfully until it returns to Allah’s command; then if it returns, make peace between them with justice and act equitably; surely Allah loves those who act equitably”. He (asws) said: ‘The two groups, but rather its explanation came on the day of Al-Basra (The battle of the Camel), and they are the ones belonging to this Verse, and they are the ones who rebelled against Amir-ul-Momineen (asws). So it was obligatory upon him (asws) to fight them, and he (asws) fought them until they submitted to the Command of Allah (azwj). And had they not been submitted, it became obligatory upon him (asws) with regards to what Allah (azwj) Revealed, that he (asws) should not raise his sword (stop fighting) until they complied and returned from their opinions, because they had pledged their allegiances willingly, without compulsion. And this is the rebel group as Allah (azwj) the High has Said. So it was obligatory upon Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) that he (asws) should deal with justice among them when he (asws) was victorious over them, just as the Rasool Allah (saww) had been just among the people of Mecca, he (saww) was benevolent upon them and forgave them. And that is what Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) did with the people of Al-Basra when he (asws) was victorious over them similar to what the Rasool Allah (saww) did with the people of Mecca. Like a sandal follows a sandal (same footsteps). I said, ‘(What about) the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[53:53] And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah)”. He (asws) said: ‘These are the people of Al-Basra. It is the overthrown city’. I said, ‘(What about) “[9:70] and the overthrown cities; their messengers came to them with clear arguments”. He (asws) said: ‘They were the people of Lut (as), their town was turned upside down upon them’.",

Umar Bin Al-Khattab said to him (ar), ‘Inform me, who you (ar) are, and who your (ar) father is, and what is your (ar) origin’.

And Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[49:13] O you men! surely We have created you of a male and a female, and made you tribes and families that you may know each other; surely the most honorable of you with Allah is the one among you most careful (of his duty)”. Then the Prophet (saww) said to Salman (ar): ‘There is no preference over you (ar) from any of these ones except by fear of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and if there is piety for you (ar) over them, so you (ar) are more preferable’.",

        "englishText": "213. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Abu Hamza, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said: ‘The Messenger (saww) asked Jibraeel (as): ‘How were the people of Saleh (as) destroyed?’ So he said: ‘O Muhammad (saww)! Saleh (as) was Sent to his (as) people when he was sixteen years old. So he (saww) was with them until he (as) reached the age of one hundred and twenty years, they did not answer him (as) to the good. And they had for themselves seventy idols which they worshipped apart from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So when he (as) saw that among them, he (as) said: ‘O people! I (as) was Sent to you all when I (as) was sixteen years old, and I (as) have now reached one hundred and twenty years, and I (as) present to you all two matters. If you like you can ask me until I (as) ask my (as) God (azwj) so He (azwj) would Answer you with regards to what you have asked me of within a short while. And if you like, I (as) would ask your gods, so if they answer me (as) by that which I (as) have asked them of, I (as) would go away from you all. So I (as) would have silenced you all and you would have silenced me (as)’. They said, ‘You (as) are being fair, O Saleh (as)’. So they prepared for the day that they will be going out for it. So they went out with their idols upon their backs, and prepared their food and drinks. So they ate and drank. When they finished, they called him (as) over. They said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Ask!’. So he (as) said to their elder: ‘What is the name of this one?’ He said, ‘Such and such’. So he (as) said to it: ‘O such and such! Answer me (as)!’ So it did not answer him (as)’. So Saleh (as) said: ‘What is the matter with it that it does not answer?’ They said, ‘Ask another one’. So he (as) asked all of them by their names, but they did not answer him (as) anything. So they turned towards their idols and said to them: ‘What is the matter with you all that you do not answer Saleh (as)?’ They did not answer. So they said, ‘Step away from us and leave us and our idols for a while’. Then they unrolled their rugs, and their furnishings, and their clothes, and wallowed upon the dust, and placed dust upon their heads, and said to their idols, ‘If you do not answer Saleh (as) today, you will be exposed’. Then they called him (as) over, so they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Call to these (idols)’. So he (as) called upon them. They did not answer him (as). So he (as) said to them: ‘O People! Half the morning has passed and I (as) have not seen your gods to have answered me (as). So ask me (as), and I (as) shall ask my (as) God (azwj), and He (azwj) will Answer you shortly’. Seventy men from their elders were delegated to him (as) from the approved ones from among them, so they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! We ask you, so if your (as) Lord (azwj) were to answer us, we would follow you (as) and answer to you (as), and pledge our allegiances to you (as), all the people of our town altogether’. So Saleh (as) said to them: ‘Ask me (as) whatsoever you like’. So they said, ‘Walk with us towards this mountain’, and the mountain was quite near to them. So Saleh (as) went with them. When he (as) came up to the mountain, they said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Call upon your (as) Lord (azwj) for us, to bring out for us from this mountain this very moment, a blonde, tame, red she-camel with a distance of a mile between the two sides of the mountain’. So Saleh (as) said to them: ‘You have asked me (as) for something which is great for me (as), and is easy for my (as) Lord (azwj) Majestic and Mighty’. Saleh (as) asked Allah (azwj) the High for that. The mountain split asunder with such a split that their intellects took flight when they heard that rumble of it. Then the mountain trembled with a great tremble like a woman trembling during labour. Then only its head came out of the crack in the mountain. When its neck showed, it began to chew its cud. Then the rest of its body came out, and it stood erect upon the ground. So when they all saw that, they said, ‘O Saleh (as), with what ease has your (as) Lord (azwj) Answered you (as). Call upon your (as) Lord (azwj) for us to bring out for us its young’. So he (as) asked Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic for that. She brought it (babies) out and walked around them. So he (as) said to them: ‘O people! Does there remain anything else?’ They said, ‘No. Come with us to our people. We shall inform them of what we have seen and they will believe in you (as)’. So they returned, but before the seventy of them could reach them, sixty four of them had reneged, and they were saying, This is sorcery and a lie’. This was reflected by all of them. So the remaining six were saying that it is the truth, whilst all the others were saying that it is a lie and sorcery. Then they all dispersed upon that, and one of the six then was overcome by doubt. So he was the one who slay it. Ibn Mahboub (the narrator) said, ‘I narrated this Hadeeth to a man from our companions called Saeed Bin Yazeed. He informed me that he had seen the mountain from which (the she-camel) came out, in Syria. He said, ‘I saw its sides where the mountain split up, and the impact of it on its sides and the other side of it, and in between it and this one was a distance of a mile’.",

        "englishText": "214. Ali Bin Muhammad, from Ali Bin Al-Abbas, from Al-Hassan Bin Abdul Rahmaan, from Ali Bin Abu Hamza, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) said when it was said to him (asws) “[54:23] (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings [54:24] For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow? Then indeed we should fall into error and madness [54:25] Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent liar!”, he (asws) said: ‘This is what they belied Saleh (as) with, and Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Destroy a people at all until He (azwj) Sends to them, before that, the Messenger (as). They argued against them (the Messengers (as)), so Allah (azwj) Sent Saleh (as) to them. He (as) called them towards Allah (azwj). They did not respond and were insolent to him (as), and said, ‘We will not believe you (as) until you (as) bring out for us from this rock a tame she-camel. And it was a rock which they used to magnify and worship and make their sacrifices near to its peak every year, and they used to gather around it. They said, ‘If you (as) are as you are alleging to be, a Prophet (as), a Messenger (as), so call upon your (as) Lord (azwj) for us until He (azwj) Brings out for us from this solid rock a tame she-camel’. So Allah (azwj) Brought it out as they had sought from him (as). Then Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Revealed unto him (as): “O Saleh (as)! Tell them that Allah (azwj) has Made a share for this she-camel, from the water, that it would drink from it one day and you would drink from it the next day”. And the day which was designated for the she-camel to drink, it would drink the water during that day. They would then milk her, and there did not remain any young one or old one except that he drank from her milk in the day of theirs when it was the night time. And in the morning they would drink from the water, and the she-camel would not drink from it during that day. So that situation prevailed until such time as Allah (azwj) so Desired it to. Then they rebelled against Allah (azwj) and some of them walked towards the others and said, ‘Slay this she-camel, and be relaxed from it. We are not happy that there should be a day for us to drink and a day for it to drink’. Then they looked around for someone who could slay it, and made for him (a reward) of what he loved. So there came to them a red, blonde, blue-eyed man, of an adulterous birth, whose father was unknown, called Qudaar. A wretched one of all wretched ones of a sinister character, so they made up for him a reward for it. So when the she-camel went towards the water to drink from it, he left it until it had drunk the water. When it returned, he sat waiting for it upon its path. He struck her with the sword but it did not kill her. So he struck at it again and killed her and it fell down upon the earth on its side, and its young ones fled until they sat upon the mountain. They cried out three times towards the sky. And the people of Saleh (as) came over. So there did not remain anyone from them except that he participated in hitting it, and they distributed its meat in between themselves. There did not remain anyone from them, whether young or old except that he ate from it. So when Saleh (as) saw that, he (as) came up to them and said, ‘O People! What called you all to do what you have done and rebelled against your Lord (azwj)?’ So Allah (azwj) Blessed and High unto Saleh (as): “Your (as) people have been tyrannous and rebellious, and killed the she-camel that was Sent to them as a Proof to them, and there was no harm in it for them, and there were great benefits from it for them. So tell them that I (azwj) will be Sending upon you all My (azwj) Punishment after three days. So they were to repent and return (from their ways), I (azwj) shall Accept their repentance and Prevent it from them, and if they do not repent and do not return (from their ways), I (azwj) will Send to them My (azwj) Punishment on the third day”. So Saleh (as) came and said to them: ‘O people! I (as) am a Messenger (as) of your Lord (azwj). He (azwj) is Saying to you all that if you were to repent and return (from your ways) and seek Forgiveness, He (azwj) would Forgive you all and Turn towards you (Mercifully)’. So when he (as) said that to them they became more rebellious and treacherous than what they had been and said, ‘O Saleh (as)! Let it come to us, what you (as) are calling for us, if you (as) are from the Messengers (as), the truthful ones’. He (as) said: ‘O people! When you wake up tomorrow morning your faces would be yellow, and on the second day your faces would be red, and on the third day your faces would be black’. So when it was the morning of the first day and their faces turned yellow, some of them walked towards the others and said, ‘There has come upon you what Saleh (as) had spoken of’. So the rebellious ones among them said, ‘We will not listen to the words of Saleh (as) and will not accept his (as) words, even though they may be great’. So when it was the morning of the second day and their faces turned red, some of them walked towards the others and said, ‘O people! There has come upon you what Saleh (as) had spoken about for you all’. So the rebellious ones among them said, ‘Even if we were all to be destroyed, we will not listen to the words of Saleh (as) nor will we leave our gods which our forefathers had been worshipping, nor will we repent, nor will we return (from our ways)’. So when it was the morning of the third day and their faces turned black. So some of them walked towards the others and said, ‘O people! There has come upon you what Saleh (as) had spoken of for you all’. So the rebellious ones from among them said, ‘Let it come upon us what Saleh (as) had said to us’. So when it was the middle of the night, Jibraeel (as) came upon them and screamed out a loud scream at them which broke their eardrums, and split their hearts, and ruptured their livers. And during those three days they had been applying camphor upon themselves, and shrouding themselves, and they knew that the Punishment would be descending upon them. So all of them died in the blink of an eye, their young ones as well as their old ones. There did not remain for them a she-camel, or a sheep, or anything except that Allah (azwj) Destroyed it. They had all died in their homes and on their beds. Then Allah (azwj) Sent upon them Fire along with the Scream from the sky. So it burnt all of them, and this was their story’.",

So if the tooth has a cavity, apply the drops by cotton, place it inside the cavity and lie down upon the back. He should do this for three nights. And if the tooth does not have a cavity to it and it has a smell to it, apply the drops in each side of that tooth during the night. Every night two or three drops. He would be free (cured) by the Permission of Allah (azwj)’. He (the narrator) said, ‘And I heard him (asws) saying: ‘For the pain in the mouth and the blood which comes out from the teeth, and the ulcers and the redness which takes place in the mouth, take damp colocynth which has turned yellow, place it in a pot of clay, pierce its head and enter a knife inside it. Then gently rub its sides, then pour over it dates and vinegar, and it would be intensely bitter. Then place it upon the fire and boil it intensely. Then take from it all that can be carried by his finger, rub it in his mouth, and gargle with the vinegar. If he likes he can transfer what is in the colocynth into a bottle or bowl. And when all that becomes less, he can refill it with vinegar, and he would be free from all that, Allah (azwj) Willing’.",

So if it is harmful for my Religion, so there is no need for me to do anything which harms my Religion, and if it is not harmful to my Religion, by Allah (azwj) I love it and it is my desire to study it’.

These were city folk from the cities of Syria, and there were seventy thousand households and plague used to occur among them every time. So whenever they sensed it, the rich ones would exit the city due to their (financial) strength and the poor would remain due to their (financial) weakness. So the death occurred mostly among those who would remain and less among those who went out. So those who left said, ‘Had we been of those who remained, death would frequent among us’. And those who remained said, ‘Had we been of those who went out, death would be less among us’. He (asws) said: ‘So they formed a consensus of their opinions that whenever they sense the plague occurring among them, all of them would go out from the city. So when they sensed the plague affecting them, all of them went out and took precaution against the death. So they travelled in the countryside for as long as Allah (azwj) so Desired. Then they passed by a city which was in ruins and its inhabitants had all left, being destroyed by the plague. So they encamped there, and settled their belongings being reassured by it. Allah (azwj) Said to them: “All of you die!” They all died at that instant and became decayed. The passers-by passed by and collected their ashes and gathered them in one place. So a Prophet (as) from the Prophets (as) of the Children of Israel passed by them, whose (as) name was Hizkeel (as). So when he (as) saw those bones, he (as) wept and reflected upon it and said: ‘O Lord (azwj)! If You (azwj) so Wish, You (azwj) can Revive them instantly, just as You (azwj) Caused them to die, so they would then inhabit Your (azwj) Country, and bear Your (azwj) servants who would worship You (azwj) along with those from Your (azwj) creatures who worship You (azwj)’. So Allah (azwj) the High Revealed unto him (as): “Is that what you (as) would like to happen?’ He (as) said: ‘Yes, O Lord (azwj)! Revive them”. So Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (as); “Say such and such”. So he (as) said that which Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic had Commanded him (as) to say’. Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘And it was the Great Name (Al-Ism Al-Aazam). So when Hizkeel (as) said that Word, he (as) saw the bones flying towards each other. So they came back alive. Some of them looked at the others Glorifying Allah (azwj) and Exclaiming His (azwj) Greatness and Extolling His (azwj) Holiness. So Hizkeel (as) said during that: ‘I (as) hereby testify that Allah (azwj) has Power over all things’.

You (ar) know that we love you (ar), and we know that you (ar) love us, and you (ar) have preserved with regards to us what the people have wasted except for a few. So your (ar) Reward is upon Allah (azwj), and it is for that that they have thrown you (ar) out as the castaway and made you (ar) travel in the exile. So your (ar) Reward is upon Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So fear Allah (azwj) and know that you (ar) should resign to the affliction from the anxiety and your (ar) deterioration of the health from the despair. So leave the resignation and the despair and say, ‘Allah (azwj) is Sufficient for me (ar) and the best ‘الْوَكِيلُ’ advocate’. Then Al-Hassan (asws) spoke saying: ‘O uncle (ar)! The people have meted out to you (ar) what you (ar) have seen, and Allah (azwj) is Watching from High above. So leave the memories of the world by remembrance of its separation and the difficulties, by what will be coming to you (ar) of the ease after it, and be patient until you (ar) meet your (ar) Prophet (saww), and he (saww) will be pleased with you (ar), Allah (azwj) Willing’. Then Al-Husayn (asws) spoke saying: ‘O uncle (ar)! Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has the Power to Change what you (ar) see, and every day He (azwj) is in (a State of) Glory. The people have denied you (ar) their world, and you (ar) have denied them your (ar) Religion. So what is your (ar) need from what they have denied you (ar), and they are in greatest need for what you (ar) have denied them. So it is for you (ar) to observe patience, for the goodness is in the patience, and the patience is from the generosity. And leave the anxiety, for the anxiety provides no refuge’. Then Ammar (ar) spoke saying, ‘O Abu Dharr (ar)! May Allah (azwj) Make lonely the one who made you (ar) to be lonely, and Frighten the one who (tried to) frightened you (ar). By Allah (azwj)! Nothing prevents the people from speaking the truth except their reliance upon the world and the love for it. But rather, the obedience is with the group and the kingdom is for the one who overcomes it, and this group of people have called the people to their world, so they responded to them for it and bestowed their Religion upon them. Thus, they incurred the loss of the world and the Hereafter, and that is what is the clear loss’. Then Abu Dharr (ar) spoke saying, ‘Peace be upon you all, and the Mercy of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Blessings! May my (ar) father and my (ar) mother (be sacrificed for you all). These are the faces, when I (ar) see them, I (ar) remember the Rasool Allah (saww). And what is there for me (ar) in Al-Medina to dwell in apart from you. And it became heavy upon Usman to let me (ar) (live) in the neighbourhood of Al-Medina just as it became heavy upon Muawiya in Syria. He (Usman) decided that he would exile me (ar) to a town, so I (ar) said it should be Al-Kufa. So he feared that I (ar) would spoil the relationship of his brother with the people in Al-Kufa. By Allah (azwj) He is sending me (ar) to a place in which I (ar) will neither see any human being nor hear a humming sound. By Allah (azwj)! I (ar) do not want anyone except Allah (azwj) as a companion, and what is the loneliness for me (ar) when Allah (azwj) is with me (ar). Allah (azwj) is Sufficient for me (ar). There is no god except for Him (azwj). Upon Him (azwj) do I (ar) rely and He (azwj) is the Lord (azwj) of the Magnificent Throne, and greetings of Allah (azwj) be upon our Chief Muhammad (saww) and his (saww) purified Progeny (asws)’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ibn Mahboub, from Ali Bin Abu Hamza, from Abu Baseer who said: I was seated with Abu Ja’far (asws) when Dawood Bin Ali, and Suleyman Bin Khalid, and Abu Ja’far Abdullah Bin Muhammad Abu Al-Dawaniqy came over and sat down in an area of the Masjid. It was said to them, ‘This is Muhammad Bin Ali (asws) seated (over there)’. So Dawood Bin Ali, and Suleyman Bin Khalid stood up and came over, whilst Abu Al-Dawaniqy remained seated in his place, until they greeted to Abu Ja’far (asws). So Abu Ja’far (asws) said to them: ‘What prevented your tyrant from coming to me (asws)?’ So they offered excuses on his behalf in his (asws) presence. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said with regards to that: ‘But, by Allah (azwj), (not many) nights and days would go by before he rules over the two regions. Then the men from his offspring would strengthen it for whom would be the reins, then they would govern with a severe government’. So Dawood Bin Ali said to him (asws), ‘And he will be ruling over us before your (asws) rule?’ He (asws) said: ‘Yes, O Dawood! He will rule over you before our (asws) kingdom, and have authority over you before our (asws) authority’. Dawood said to him (asws), ‘May Allah (azwj) Keep you (asws) well, is there a time frame for it?’ He (asws) said: ‘Yes, O Dawood. By Allah (azwj), the Clan of Umayya will not rule for a day except that you will rule for twice as much, and will not rule for a year but you will rule for twice as much, and the children from among you would seize it just like children seize the ball’. Dawood Bin Ali stood up from the presence of Abu Ja’far (asws) with joy, intending to inform Abu Al-Dawaniqy of that. So when both, him and Suleyman Bin Khalid arose, Abu Ja’far called them back (to him (asws)): ‘O Suleyman Bin Khalid! The people would not cease from having space from their reign if they do not shed the blood from us (asws) unlawfully’ – and he (asws) gestured by his (asws) hand to his (asws) chest. ‘So if they shed that blood, the inside of the earth would be better for them than its surface, for on that Day there would not be any helper for them in the earth, nor a Forgiver for them in the sky’. Then Suleyman Bin Khalid went and informed Abu Al-Dawaniqy. So Abu Al-Dawaniqy came over to Abu Ja’far (asws). He greeted to him (asws), then informed him (asws) of what Dawood bin Ali and Suleyman Bin Khalid had told him. So he (asws) said to him: ‘Yes, O Abu Ja’far! Your government is before our (asws) government, and your authority would be before our (asws) authority. Your authority would be extremely difficult and there would be no ease in it and would have a long duration for it. By Allah (azwj)!

Do you understand?’ Then he (asws) said: ‘The force of your reign will not decline so long as you do not shed our (asws) blood unlawfully. But if you shed that blood, Allah (azwj) would be Wrathful, so your kingdom and authority would go away, and your power would go away, and Allah (azwj) would Make you to be overcome by a slave from the blind slaves, and he would not be more blind than the progeny of Abu Sufyan, and your eradication would be by his hands and the hands of his companions’.

There was a group of Shites over there, so I (asws) greeted them, and then said: ‘By Allah (azwj)! I (asws) love your aromas, and your spirits, so help me (asws) upon that by being pious and striving. And know that our (asws) Wilayah cannot be achieved except by piety and the striving, and the one from among you who follows a servant (an Imam (asws)); he should emulate what he does. You are the Shites of Allah (azwj), and you are the Helpers of Allah (azwj), and you are the foremost of the former ones, and the foremost of the later ones, and the foremost in the world, and the foremost in the Hereafter (and) to the Paradise. We (asws) have taken your responsibility for the Paradise on the Guarantee of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the guarantee of the Rasool Allah (saww). By Allah (azwj)! There are no Levels of the Paradise where there are more Spirits than yours, so compete for the higher Levels. You are the good ones and your women are the good ones. Every Believing woman is a virgin Hourie and every Believer is a Truthful one. And Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) has said to Qanbar: ‘Receive good news, rejoice with the good news, and convey the good news, for, by Allah (azwj), the Rasool Allah (saww) passed away while he (saww) was angry with his (saww) community except for the Shites’. Indeed! For everything there is an honour and the honour of Al-Islam are the Shites. Indeed! For everything there is a pillar and the pillar of Al-Islam are the Shites. Indeed! For everything there is a chief and the chief of the gatherings is the gathering of the Shites. Indeed! For every thing is an Imam, and the Imam of the earth is the land on which the Shites live. By Allah (azwj)! Had you all not been in the earth, an eye would have never ever see herbs. By Allah (azwj)! Had you all not been in the earth, Allah (azwj) would not have Favoured the people who oppose you nor would they have been in any goodness. They would have nothing for them in the world nor any share for them in the Hereafter. Every hostile one (Nasibi), if he were to worship, and struggle, would be attributed to this Verse: “[88:3] Toiling, Hostile one [88:4] Entering into burning fire”. So every Hostile One (Nasibi) who struggles, his deeds would be wasted. Our (asws) Shites speak with the ‘بِنُورِ’ Light of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the one who are opposed to them speak by instinct (biological needs). By Allah (azwj)! There is none from our (asws) Shites who sleeps, except that Allah (azwj) Makes his soul to ascend to the sky to be Blessed. So if its term (death) has come, He (azwj) Makes it to be within the Treasures of His (azwj) Mercy, and in the Gardens of Paradise, and in the Shade of His (azwj) Throne. And if its term (death) has been delayed, He (azwj) sends it back along with the trusted Angels to return it to the body from which it came out to dwell in it. By Allah (azwj) those of you who perform the Hajj and the Umrah are the special ones of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic.

So that becomes such and such a torrent and other than that. Thus, it rains upon the area which it had been Ordered to. There is no drop from the drops except that there is an Angel with it until he places it in a particular place.

Indeed! The best of the servants of Allah (azwj) is a pious servant. The Arabic is not by a father and (grand) father, but it is a spoken tongue (language). So the one who is deficient in his deeds, his lineage would not help him. Indeed! Every blood (shed) during the era of ignorance, or feud – and the feud is the enmity – so it is now under my (saww) feet. This is how it will be up to the Day of Judgement’.",

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Muhammad Bin Al-No’man Abu Ja’far Al-Ahowl, from salaam Bin Al-Mustaneer, who has said the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) having said that: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), when the story in between him (asws) and Talha, and Al-Zubeyr, and Ayesha concluded at Al-Basra, he (asws) ascended the Pulpit. So he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), and sent greetings upon the Rasool Allah (saww), then said: ‘O you people! The world is sweet and green, enchanting the people by the desires, and adorning them with its current affairs. And I (asws) swear by Allah (azwj) that it deceives the one who hopes in it, and breaks the one who wishes for it, and there are people who would be inheriting the regret and the sorrow by advancing towards it and competing with regards to it, by their jealousies and their rebellion against the people of the religion. And they achieve preferences in it by injustice, and animosity, and rebellion, and ungratefulness. By Allah (azwj)! No people lived in the honour and dignity of the Bounties of Allah (azwj) in the life of the world, nor everlasting piety in obedience to Allah (azwj) and the appreciation for His (azwj) Bounties, and all that declined from them except after they had changed themselves, and diverted from the obedience to Allah (azwj), and committed their sins were hardly vigilant, and ignored the Surveillance of Allah (azwj) Majestic and Mighty, and being complacent of appreciation for the Bounties of Allah (azwj), because Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic is Saying in the Decisive (Verses) of His (azwj) Book that: “[13:11] surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector”. And had the people of the disobedience, and the accumulators of the sins been cautious of the decline of the Bounties of Allah (azwj) (for them) and their replacement by His (azwj) Anger and the changing of their health, been convinced that it is from Allah (azwj) for what their own hands have accumulated, they would have changed, and repented, and panicked to Allah (azwj) by the sincerity of their intentions, and acknowledgement of their sins and their offences, He (azwj) would Forgive all the sins and Overlook all the faults, and Return to them all the Prestigious Bounties. Then He (azwj) would Correct their affairs, and from all that He (azwj) had Favoured them by which had declined from them and had been spoilt. So fear Allah (azwj), O you people, with the rightful fear, and feel the fear of Allah (azwj) and be convinced with sincerity, and repent to Him (azwj) from the ugliness of what the Satan (la) has enticed you with of the fighting against ‘وَلِيِّ الْأَمْرِ وَ أَهْلِ الْعِلْمِ’ the Master (asws) of the Command (Wali Al-Amr) and the People (asws) of the Knowledge after the Rasool Allah (saww) and do not co-operate with those who create differences in the group, and disperse the affairs, and spoil the relationships. Allah (azwj) Accept the repentance and Excuses the sins, and He (azwj) Knows what you are doing’.",

So she said to him, It was this Umary who has hurt me’. So he said to her, ‘Let him come into the corridor’. So she let him in, and he pounced hard and killed him, and threw his body onto the street’ So the Bakries, and Umaries, and Usmaanies gathered and said, ‘There is no match for our companion. We will not avenge his killing except by Ja’far Bin Muhammad, and we will not kill for our companion except him (asws). And Abu Abdullah (asws) had gone near the Quba. So I met him (asws) and told of the gathering of the people against him (asws). So he (asws) said: ‘Leave them’. So when they came and saw him (asws), they were aggressive against him (asws) and said, ‘No one killed our companion apart from you (asws), and we will not kill anyone apart from you (asws)’. So he (asws) said; ‘Let a group from you speak to me (asws)’. So a group separated itself from them, grabbed him (asws) by the hand and entered with him (asws) into the Masjid. So when they came out, they were saying, ‘Our Sheikh is Abu Abdullah Ja’far Bin Muhammad (asws). We seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) that there was someone like him (asws) and for having done this, or ordered for it’. They dispersed. When they had finished with him (asws), I said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), how close was their happiness from their anger’. He (asws) said: ‘Yes. I (asws) called them, so I (asws) said: ‘Let me (asws) go or else I (asws) will bring out the Parchment!’ So I said, ‘And what is this Parchment, may I be sacrificed for you (asws)?’ So he (asws) said: ‘The mother of Al-Khattaab was a slave girl of Al-Zubeyr Bin Abdul Muttalib. Nufeyl seduced her and impregnated her. So Zubeyr was looking for him, and he fled to Al-Taef. Zubeyr went out behind him. Saqeef saw him and said, ‘O Abu Abdullah, what are you doing over here?’ My maid was seduced by Nufeyl’. So he ran away from it to Syria and Al-Zubeyr went out on business to Syria. So he came up to the King of Dowmat who said to him, ‘O Abu Abdullah! I have a need from you’. He said, ‘And what is your need, O King’. He said, ‘A man from your people has taken his son, so I would love to return him back to his father’. He said, ‘Display him to me until I can recognise him’. So when it was the morning, he came up to the King. When the King saw him, he laughed. So he said, ‘What made you to laugh, O King?’ He said, ‘I don’t think that this man has been born to an Arab. When he saw you entering, he could not control his backside and released wind’. He said, ‘O King! When I go to Makkah, I shall fulfil your request’. So when Al-Zubeyr went he carried him to the Qureysh who insisted that he hand over to him (Nufayl) his son (Al-Khattaab born from the slave girl of Al-Zubeyr). Then they took him to Abdul Muttalib (as). So he said, ‘There is nothing between myself and him. Do you not know what he has done with regards to my son, so and so? But you all go to him, try to persuade him, and speak to him’. Al-Zubeyr said to them, ‘The Satan (la) has a dominion to himself (la), and that the son of this man is the son of Satan (la) and I do not feel safe that (tomorrow) he might become a leader over us. But, enter him in the door of the Masjid to me that I should take an iron and mark his face with it, and write down against him and his son that they shall not be part of our gatherings, and will not issue any orders on our children, nor will they cast arrows with us’. So they did that, and marked his face with the iron, and wrote against him a document, and that document is in our (asws) possession. So I (asws) told them: ‘Let me (asws) go or else I (asws) would bring out the document, for in it is your scandal’. So they let me (asws) go’. And a slave of the Rasool Allah (saww) died and did not leave any inheritors behind. So the sons of Al-Abbas and Abu Abdullah (asws) disputed with regards to it, and Hisham Bin Abdul Malik was performing the Pilgrimage during that year. So he sat (in Judgement) for them. So Dawood Bin Ali said, ‘The guardianship (of this legacy) is for us’, and Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘But, the guardianship (of this legacy) is for me (asws)’. Dawood Bin Ali said that, ‘Your (asws) father fought against Muawiya’. So he (asws) said: ‘If my (asws) father fought against Muawiya, so there was for your father an abundant share of it, then he fled after his embezzlement’. And he (asws) said; ‘By Allah (azwj)! Tomorrow I shall place upon your neck the collar of the pigeons’. Dawood Bin Ali said to him (asws), ‘This speech of yours (asws) is lower to me than the droppings of a camel in the valley of Al-Arzaq’. He (asws) said: ‘As for the valley, there is no right either for you or your father therein’. So Hisham said, ‘When it is the morning, I shall sit (in Judgement) for you’. So when it was the next morning, Abu Abdullah (asws) came out, and with him (asws) was a document in a bag, and Hisham sat (in Judgement) for them. So Abu Abdullah (asws) place the document in front of him. So when he (Hisham) read it, he said, ‘Call Jandal Al-Jaza’iy and Ukkashat Al-Zamry for me’. And these were two old men who had lived through the era of ignorance. So He threw the document towards them and said, ‘Do you two recognise these handwritings?’ They said, ‘Yes. This is the handwriting of Al-A’as Bin Umayya, and this is the handwriting of so and so for so and so from Qureysh, and this is the handwriting of Harb Bin Umayya’. So Hisham said, ‘I see that you (asws) have in your (asws) possession the writings of our forefathers’. He (asws) said: ‘Yes’. He said, ‘So I hereby judge it to be in your (asws) guardianship’. He (asws) went out saying: ‘If the scorpion returns, the shoe would be ready to crush it’. So I said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), what is this document?’ He (asws) said: ‘Nutaylat was a maid for the mother of Al-Zubeyr, and for Abu Talib (as), and Abdullah (as). So Abdul Muttalib (as) took her, and she gave birth to her son so and so (Al-Abbas)’. So Al-Zubeyr said to them, ‘We have inherited this maid from our mother and your son. This is a slave for us. So he took him to the middle of Qureysh. He said, ‘I will answer you on the condition that this son of your will not participate in a gathering, nor will he cast arrows with us’. So he wrote against them a document, and testified against them. So this is that document’.",

They said, ‘What has Made Allah (azwj) to Make this cow to speak?’ So it called out among them for a second time’. So they decided to build a ship.

Ibn Mahboub, from Jameel Bin Salih, from Abu Ubeyda who said: I asked Abu Ja’far (asws) about the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[30:1] Alif Lam Mim [30:2] The Romans have been defeated [30:3] In a near land”. O Abu Ubeyda! No one knows the explanation of this except for Allah (azwj) and the ones (asws) firmly rooted in Knowledge from the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww). The Rasool Allah (saww), when he (saww) migrated to Al-Medina and displayed Al-Islam, he (saww) wrote to the king of Rome a letter, and sent it with a messenger calling him to Al-Islam, and he (saww) wrote a letter to the king of Persia a letter calling him to Al-Islam and sent it with his (saww) messenger to him. So, as for the king of Rome, so he respected the letter and honoured his (saww) messenger, and as for the king of Persia, so he belittled the letter of the Rasool Allah (saww), and tore it up and belittled his (saww) messenger. In those days the king of Persia was at war with the king of Rome, and the Muslims desired that the king of Rome should overcome the king of Persia, and they were on his side hoping against the king of Persia. So when the king of Persia overcame the king of Rome the Muslims did not like that and were grieved by it. So Allah (azwj) Revealed with that in the Quran: “[30:1] Alif Lam Mim [30:2] The Romans have been defeated [30:3] In a near land”, meaning it was overcome by Persia in a nearby land, and it is Syria and what is around it, and they, meaning Persia from after having overcome Rome will be overcoming, meaning the Muslims would be overcoming, “[30:4] Within a few years. Allah’s is the command before and after; and on that day the believers shall rejoice [30:5] With the help of Allah; He helps whom He pleases” and He (azwj) is Mighty and Majestic. So when the Muslims invaded Persia and conquered it, the Muslims were happy with the Help of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic’. So I said, ‘Does not Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Say: “[30:4] Within a few years”, whereas the Believers spent many years with the Rasool Allah (saww), and in the rule of Abu Bakr. But rather, the Believers overcame Persia during the rule of Umar’. So he (asws) said: ‘Did I (asws) not say to you that this is the explanation and the interpretation? O Abu Ubeyda! And the Quran has Abrogating (verses) and Abrogated (Verses). Have you not heard the Words of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “Allah’s is the command before and after”? It means the Decision is His (azwj) in the Words whether he (azwj) Delays what was to happen first, or to bring forward that which was Delayed in the Words up to the Day the matter has been Ordained to occur by the Descent of the Help upon the Believers with regards to it. So that is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “and on that day the believers shall rejoice [30:5] With the help of Allah; He helps whom He pleases”, yes, the day on which the Help has been Ordained to occur’.",

So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Have you not recited the Book of Allah (azwj)? Has not Allah (azwj) said: “[3:144] And Muhammad is no more than a messenger; the messengers have already passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels?

He (asws) said: ‘The people want me (asws), so come with me (asws)’. I stood up and went with him (asws).

Then he (asws) took me by the hand and left them and went away. So when we came out form the Masjid, he (asws) said to me: ‘O Abu Muhammad!

So he (saww) said: ‘Who will go and bring their news to us, and the Paradise will be for him’. No one stood up. He (saww) then repeated it. Still no one stood up’. Abu Abdullah (asws) said, with a hand gesture: ‘What the people wanted was something higher than the Paradise’. Then he (saww) said; ‘Who is this?’ He said, ‘Huzeyfa’. So he (saww) said; ‘Did you not hear my (saww) words since the night and I (saww) have been speaking? Come closer’. So Huzeyfa stood up and he was saying, ‘It was neither the cold nor the harm which prevented me, may I be sacrificed for you (saww)’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘Go to them until you can hear their speech, and come to me (saww) with their news’. So when he went, the Rasool Allah (saww) said; ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Protect him from his front, and from his back, and from his right, and from his left, until he returns’. And the Rasool Allah (saww) said to him; ‘O Huzeyfa, do not narrate anything until you come to me (saww)’. So he took his sword, and his bow, and his shield. Huzeyfa said, ‘I went out and I was not affected by the cold weather, I passed by the Door of the Ditch (Baab Al-Khandaq) which had been overcome by the Believers from the Infidels’. So when Huzayfa left, the Rasool Allah (saww) arose and called out: ‘وَ نَادَى يَا صَرِيخَ الْمَكْرُوبِينَ وَ يَا مُجِيبَ الْمُضْطَرِّينَ اكْشِفْ هَمِّي وَ غَمِّي وَ كَرْبِي فَقَدْ تَرَى حَالِي وَ حَالَ أَصْحَابِي’ ‘O Helper of the afflicted, and O Responder to the distressed, Uproot my (saww) stress, and my (saww) grief, and my (saww) affliction, for You (azwj) can See my (saww) condition, and the condition of my (saww) companions!’ So Jibraeel (as) descended unto him (saww) and said; ‘O Rasool Allah (saww)! Verily Allah (azwj) has Heard your (saww) speech, and your (saww) supplication, and has Answered you (saww), and Suffices for you (saww) against your (saww) enemies’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) went down on his (saww) knees, and extended his (saww) hands, and shed tears from his (saww) eyes, then said: ‘شُكْراً شُكْراً كَمَا رَحِمْتَنِي وَ رَحِمْتَ أَصْحَابِي’ ‘Thank You (azwj), thank You (azwj) for being Merciful to me (saww) and to my (saww) companions’. Then the Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘Allah (azwj) has Sent upon them a wind from the sky to the world in which was gravel, and a wind from the fourth sky in which was a rock’. Huzeyfa said, ‘I went out and I saw that the people had lit many fires. And the first soldier of Allah (azwj), a wind in which was gravel, struck them. So it did not leave any of their fires except that it extinguished it, no tent except that it uprooted it, and no spear except that it flung it away, to the extent that they were defending themselves against the gravel with their shields and we could hear the sound of the gravel striking the shields’. Huzayfa sat down in between two men from the Polytheists. Iblees (la) stood up in the form of an obedient man among the Polytheists. He (la) said, ‘O you people! You all have encamped in an area besides this sorcerer and the liar. Indeed! Nothing from his (saww) matters has been forgotten. It has not been a good year. The shoes and the hooves have been destroyed. So return, and every man from among you should look at the one who is seated next to him’. Huzayfa said, ‘So I looked on my right and tapped on his shoulder and said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘Muawiya’. So I said to the one who was on my left, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘Suhayl Bin Amro’. Huzayfa said, ‘And the greater soldier of Allah (azwj) arrived. So Abu Sufyan arose to be on his camel, then shouted among the Qureysh, ‘The safety, the safety!’ And Talha Al-Azdy said, ‘Muhammad (saww) has increased your injuries!’ Then he climbed upon his camel and shouted among the Clan of Ashja’a, ‘The safety, the safety!’ And Uyayna Bin Hasan acted similarly. Then Al-Haris Bin Awf Al-Muzny acted similarly. Then Al-Aqra’a Bin Habis acted similarly. And so the confederated tribes (Al-Ahzaab) went away’. And Huzayfa returned to the Rasool Allah (saww) and informed him (saww) of the news. And Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘It had resembled the Day of Judgement for them’.",

So when we ended up to Al-Kunasa, he (asws) said: ‘Over there is where they crucified my (asws) uncle Zayd, may Allah (azwj) have Mercy upon him’. Then we went until we ended up at the (market) stall of the oilmen, and it was at the end of the two lamps. So he (asws) descended and said: ‘Descend, for this is the place where the Masjid Al-Kufa used to be at first which Adam (as) had marked, and I (asws) do not like that I (asws) should enter it riding’. I said, ‘So who was the other one who had marked it?’ He (asws) said: ‘As for the first one, that was the storm during the era of Noah (as). Then others from the companions of Chosroe and Nu’man, and thereafter Ziyad Bin Abu Sufyan’. So I said, ‘And there was a Masjid at Al-Kufa during the era of Noah (as)?’ He (asws) said to me; ‘Yes, O Mufazzal. And the houses of Noah (as) and his (as) people were in a town, at a place from the Euphrates which follows west of Al-Kufa’. He (asws) said: ‘And Noah (as) was a carpenter. So Allah (azwj) Made him (as) a Prophet (as) and Answered him (as). And Noah (as) was the first one to make a ship which flowed upon the back of the water’. He (asws) said: ‘And Noah (as) lived among his (as) people for fifty years less a thousand years (950), calling them to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. However, they derided him (as) and laughed at him (as). So when he (as) saw that from them, he (as) supplicated against them saying: ‘Lord (azwj)! Do not Leave upon the earth any house of the infidels. If You (azwj) Leave them, they will lead astray Your (azwj) servants, and will not give birth to anyone except the infidel tyrants’. So Allah (azwj) Revealed unto Noah (as) that he (as) should make a ship and make it a big one, and hurriedly. So Noah (as) made a ship in Masjid Al-Kufa by his (as) hands. He brought the wood from afar until he (as) finished it. Al-Mufazzal said, ‘Then Abu Abdullah (asws) interrupted the Hadith during the sunset. So Abu Abdullah (asws) stood up and Prayed the Midday Salat (Al-Zohar), and the Afternoon Salat (Al-Asar), then left from the Masjid. He (asws) indicated by his (asws) hand to his (asws) left to a place where there was a house among the houses, and it was the place of the house of Ibn Hakeym, and where is Euphrates today, so he (asws) said to me: ‘O Mufazzal! Over there is where the idols of the people of Noah (as) were fixed – Yagows, and Yaowq, and Nasraa’. Then he (asws) went and rode upon his (asws) animal. So I said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), how long did it take for Noah (as) to build his (as) ship until he (as) finished it?’ He (asws) said: ‘In two time periods’. I said, ‘And how long are these two time periods?’ He (asws) said: ‘Eighty years’. I said, ‘The general Muslim are saying that he (as) built it over five hundred years’. He (asws) said: ‘No! How are they saying this, and by Allah (azwj) it has been Revealed to us (asws)?’ I said, ‘Inform me about the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[23:27] and when Our command is given and the oven overflows” so where is its place and how was it?’ He (asws) said: ‘It was the oven in the house of an elderly believing woman in the direction of the Qiblah, on the right of the Masjid’. I said to him (asws), ‘So that is the place of the corner of the Baab Al-Feel today’. Then I said to him (asws), ‘And that is oven where the water started coming from?’ He (asws) said: ‘Yes. Allah (azwj) Loved to show a sign to the people of Noah (as). Then Allah (azwj) Sent rain upon them which flooded them with a flood, and the Euphrates overflowed with a flood, and then all the rivers overflowed. Thus Allah (azwj) Drowned all of them and saved Noah (as) and those who were with him (as) in the ship’. So I said to him, ‘How long did Noah (as) remain in the ship until the water subsided, and he (as) came out from it?’ He (asws) said: ‘He (as) remained in it for seven days and nights. It circled around the House for a week, then settled upon the Mount Joudy, and it is Euphrates of Al-Kufa’. I said to him (asws), ‘The Masjid of Al-Kufa is old?’ He (asws) said: ‘Yes, and it is a Praying place of Prophets (as), and the Rasool Allah (saww) had Prayed in it when he (saww) Taken on an ascension to the sky. So Jibraeel (as) said to him (as): ‘O Muhammad (saww)! This is a Mosque of your (saww) father Adam (as), and a Praying Place of the Prophets (as)’. So he (saww) descended and Prayed therein.

So he (ar) chased the wolf away by his (ar) staff. So the wolf came from his (ar) right. So Abu Dharr (ar) chased it away. Then Abu Dharr (ar) said to it, ‘I (ar) have not seen a wolf more vicious or evil than you’. So the wolf said to him (ar), ‘By Allah (azwj)! The people of Makkah are more evil than I am. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Sent a Prophet (saww) to them, so they belied him (saww) and insulted him (saww)’. This reverberated in the ears of Abu Dharr (ar). So he (ar) said to his (ar) wife, ‘Prepare my (ar) provisions and give it to me (asws) along with my (asws) walking stick’. Then he (ar) went out on his feet towards Makkah to know the news of what the wolf had come up with. He (ar) reached Makkah and entered it at a time when it was hot, and he (ar) was exhausted. So he (ar) came up to Zamzam (well) and was thirsty. He (ar) filled a bucket and it turned out to be milk. So he (ar) said to himself, ‘This evidences to me (ar) to what the wolf had informed me (ar) of and what I (ar) have come to is right. So he (ar) drank and went to a side from the sides of the Masjid. There was a group of Qureysh there, so he (ar) sat among them. He (ar) saw them insulting the Prophet (saww) just as the wolf had said. They did not stop mentioning the Prophet (saww) and insulting him (saww) until Abu Talib (as) came up at the end of the night. So when they saw him (as), some of them said to the others, ‘Refrain, for his (saww) uncle (as) is coming!’ They refrained. He (ar) said, ‘He (as) did not stop narrating to them and speaking to them until it was the end of the day. Then he (as) stood up, and I (ar) arose following his (as) footsteps. So he (as) turned towards me (ar) and said, ‘Mention your (ar) need’. So I (ar) said, ‘This Prophet (saww) who has been Sent among you’.

So I (ar) said, ‘The Prophet (saww), the one Sent among you’.

So the Rasool Allah (saww) said to me (ar); ‘O Abu Dharr (ar)! Go to your city, for you (ar) will find that a son of your (ar) uncle has died and there is no inheritor for him apart from you (ar). So take his wealth and stay in the presence of your (ar) family until our (saww) matter is made apparent’. So Abu Dharr (ar) returned, took the wealth and stayed in the presence of his family until the matter of the Rasool Allah (saww) was made apparent’.

So he said, ‘Has there been a birth tonight among you?’ They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Then there has been born in Palestine a boy (saww). His (saww) name is Ahmad (saww). He (saww) is with a black silky mole, and there will occur destruction of the People of the Book, and the Jews by his (saww) hands. By Allah (azwj), you are mistaken, O group of Qureysh’. So they dispersed and asked around. They were informed that a boy has been born to Abdullah Bin Abdul Muttalib (as). So they sought the man, met him and said, ‘By Allah (azwj), a boy has been born among us’. He said, ‘Was it before I spoke to you, or after what I spoke to you?’ They said, ‘It was before you spoke to us’. He said, ‘Come with me until I look at him (saww). So they went and came to his (saww) mother (as). They said, ‘Bring out the boy (saww) to us until we look at him (saww)’. She (as) said, ‘By Allah (azwj), my (as) son (saww) dropped and he (saww) did not drop like the newly born drop. He (saww) leaned upon the ground by his (saww) hands, and raised his (saww) head towards the sky. So he (saww) looked at it. Then Light came out from him (saww) to the extent that I saw the castles of Basra, and heard a call in the atmosphere saying: ‘You (as) have blessed with the Chief of the community. So when you (as) pick him (saww) up say, ‘I (as) seek refuge for him (saww) with the One (azwj), from the evil of every envious one, and name him (saww) Muhammad (saww)’. The man said, ‘Bring him (saww) out’. So she (as) brought him (saww) out. He looked at him (saww), then turned him (saww) over and looked at the mole between his (saww) shoulder blades. He fell down unconscious. So they took the boy (saww), and gave him (saww) to his (saww) mother (as) and said, ‘May Allah (azwj) Bless you (as) with regards to him (saww)’. When they went out, he had regained consciousness, so they said to him, ‘What is the matter with you? Woe be unto you!’ He said, ‘The Prophet-hood has gone from the Children of Israel up to the Day of Judgement. By Allah (azwj)! This is the one who (saww) will destroy them’. The Quresyh were happy with that. So when he saw that they had become happy, he said, ‘You are becoming happy?

He (as) supplicated against him, so he died as well, to the extent that he (as) saw a third one, and he (as) supplicated against him and he died too.

Mars is a hot planet and Saturn is a cold planet. So if Mars begins to rise, the Saturn goes lower, and that is in the spring. So they do not stop being like that. Every time Mars rises a level, Saturn falls for three months until the Mars ends up high and Saturn ends up in the decline. For the Mars that is its hottest time. So when it is at the end of the summer and the beginning of the autumn, Saturn begins to ascend and the Mars begins to descend. So these two do not stop being like that. Every time Saturn rises a level, Mars declines a level, and that is at the beginning of the winter and at the end of the summer. So that is its coldest time. Every time this one rises, this one comes down, and every time this one comes down, this one rises. So if there is a cold day in the summer, so that is the action of the Moon, and if there is a hot day in the winter, so that action is due to the Sun. “[36:38] that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing” and I (asws) am the servant of the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds’.",

Some of them encamped at Tayma and some of them at Fadak, and some of them at Khyber’. The ones who were at Tayma longed to be with some of their brothers. A Bedouin from Qays, passed by them so they hired (a camel) from him and he said to them, ‘I shall pass with you in between Ayr and Ohad’. They said to him, ‘When you pass by these two, point these two places out to us. So when he was in the middle of the land of Al-Medina, he said to them, ‘That is Ayr and this is Ohad’. So they descended from the backs of his camels and said, ‘We have reached where we wanted to be, therefore we do not have any need for your camels, and so you can go to wherever you like’. And they wrote to their brothers who were at Fadak and Khyber, ‘We have got to the place so come to us’. They wrote back to them, ‘We have settled in the houses and acquired assets, and there is no one closer to us than you are. So when that event transpires, we would quickly come to you’. They acquired assets in the land of Al-Medina. When their wealth increased, it (news) reached Tubba and he attacked them. They fortified themselves from him, so he surrounded them. They felt sympathetic towards the weak ones of Tubba and they would throw the dates and the barley towards them at night. So (the news of) that reached Tubba, and he sympathised with them and granted them amnesty. They came down to him. He said to them, ‘I have come to like your city and would like to reside among you’. So they said to him, ‘It is not for you to dwell in that place, for a Prophet (saww) would be emigrating and that is not for anyone until that happens’. He said to them, ‘I will leave behind among you members of my family, so when that happens, they would support him (saww) and help him (saww)’. So he left behind two tribes, Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj.

(But) that is for the one who comes out from his house with provisions, and lawful means of transportation aspiring for this House while having recognised our (asws) rights, loving us (asws) with his heart, just as Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[14:37] therefore make the hearts of some people yearn towards them” and it does not mean the House, for He (azwj) is Saying ‘towards them’. So we (asws) are, by Allah (azwj), the supplication of Ibrahim (as) towards whom (asws) if one loves with one’s heart, his Pilgrimage would be Accepted, otherwise it will not be, O Qatada! So if it is like that, he would be safe from the Punishment of Hell on the Day of Judgement’. Qatada said, ‘No offence. By Allah (azwj), I will not explain it except like this’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘Woe be unto you, O Qatada! But rather, you should understand the Quran from the ones (asws) who have been addressed by it’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from Muhammad Bin Isa, from Yunus, from Mufazzal Bin Salih, from Jabir, who has said: Abu Ja’far (asws) says that the Prophet (saww) said: ‘The Trustworthy Spirit (Jibraeel) informed me (saww) that Allah (azwj), there is no god apart from Him (azwj), when He (azwj) Pauses the creatures and Gathers the former ones and the later ones, Hell will be brought by a thousand reins, each rein grabbed by a hundred thousand Angels from the strong and harsh ones, making crushing, and shattering sounds with its exhalation and inhalation, sighing in its exhalation. And if Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Delay it until the Accounting is dealt with, it would destroy all. Then a neck would come out from it, which would encompass the creatures, be they righteous or be they tyrants from among them. So there is no creature of Allah (azwj), a servant from His (azwj) servants, Angel, or Prophet (as) except that he would call out, ‘O Lord (azwj), (save) my soul! (save) my soul! Whilst you (saww) would be saying: ‘O Lord (azwj), (save) my (saww) community! (save) My (saww) community! Then a Bridge would be placed over it, thinner than the hair, and sharper than the sword. It would have three hurdles for it. The first one being the fulfilment of the trusts and the mercy; and the second being the Salat’ and the third being the Lord (azwj) of the Words, there is no god apart from Him (azwj). So they will be mandated to cross over it. They would be captivated by the mercy and the fulfilment of the trust stage. So if they can be rescued from it, the Salat stage would capture them. So if they can be rescued from it, they would end up to the Lord (azwj) of the Worlds, Majestic is His (azwj) Mention, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High: “[89:14] Lo! Your Lord is ever watchful”. And the people would be upon the Bridge, (some) of their feet slipping and (some) of their feet firm; and the Angels would be around them Calling out: ‘O Benevolent! O Lenient! Excuse them, and Forgive them, and Return by Your (azwj) Grace, and Secure them while the people would be flocking on it like moths. So the one who is saved would be so by the Mercy of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High would look at it (the Bridge) and say, ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) Who Rescued me from you (the Bridge) after finding me lost and in desperation, by His (azwj) Grace. Surely, our Lord (azwj) is Forgiving, Appreciative’.",

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, from Ali Bin Al-Hakam, from Al-Husayn Abu Al-A’ala Al-Khaffaf, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) has said: ‘When the people were defeated on the Day of Ohad and fled from the Prophet (saww), he (saww) turned towards them with his (saww) face and was saying: ‘I (saww) am Muhammad (saww)! I (saww) am the Rasool Allah (saww)! I (saww) have neither been killed nor have I (saww) died’. So and so, and so and so (Abu Bakr and Umar) turned towards him (saww) saying, ‘Now he (saww) is mocking with us as well and we have been defeated. And there remained with him (saww) Ali (asws) and Samaak Bin Kharsha Abu Dujana (ar), may Allah (azwj) have Mercy on him. So the Prophet (saww) called him (ar) over and said: ‘O Abu Dujana! Leave, for you (ar) are free from your pledge of allegiance. As for Ali (asws), so I (saww) am him (asws) and he (asws) is me (saww)’. So he came over and sat down in front of the Prophet (saww) and wept, and said, ‘No, by Allah (azwj)!’ And he (ar) raised his (ar) head towards the sky and said, ‘No, by Allah (azwj)! I (ar) will not make myself free from my pledge of allegiance. I (ar) gave my (ar) pledge of allegiance to you (saww), so where shall I (ar) go, to a wife who will die, or a son who will die, or a house which will be ruined and wealth which will be destroyed, and a term (death) which comes nearer?’ So the Prophet (saww) left him (ar), and he (ar) did not stop fighting until he was weakened by the wounds and he (ar) was on one side of him (saww) and Ali (asws) was on the other side of him (saww). So when he (ar) dropped, Ali (asws) carried him (ar) to the Prophet (saww) and placed him (ar) in his (saww) presence. So he (ar) said, ‘O Rasool Allah (saww), have I (ar) been loyal to my (ar) pledge of allegiance?’ He (saww) said: ‘Yes’. And the Prophet (saww) said good things for him (ar). And the people were attacking the Prophet (saww) from the right, so Ali (asws) defended him (saww). So when he (asws) defended him (saww), they attacked the Prophet (saww) from the left. That situation did not cease until his (asws) sword broke into three pieces. So he (asws) came to the Prophet (saww). He (asws) displayed it in front him (saww) and said: ‘This is my (asws) sword which has broken. Thus, it was on that day that the Prophet (saww) gave him (asws) Za Al-Fiqar (Zulfiqar). And when the Prophet (saww) saw that (Ali (asws)) was exhausted due to the frequency of the fighting, he (saww) raised his (saww) head towards the sky and he wept and said: ‘O Lord (azwj)! You (azwj) Promised me (saww) that You (azwj) would be Making Your (azwj) Religion to prevail, and if You (azwj) so Desire, it would not Tire You (azwj)’. Ali (asws) turned towards the Prophet (saww) and said: ‘O Rasool Allah (saww)! I (asws) heard a loud rumble and heard the galloping of Hayzoum (Horse of Jibraeel), and I (asws) did not attack to strike anyone except that he would fall dead before I (asws) struck him. So he (saww) said: ‘This was Jibraeel and Mikaeel, and Israfeel among the Angels’. Then Jibraeel (as) went and paused to the side of the Rasool Allah (saww). He said: ‘O Muhammad (saww), this is the comfort’. So he (saww) said: ‘Ali (asws) is from me (asws), and I (saww) am from him (asws)’. So Jibraeel said: ‘And I am from both of you (asws). Then the people (enemy) were defeated. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said to Ali (asws): ‘O Ali (asws)! Go with your (asws) sword until you are opposite to them. If you (asws) see them riding the camels and the horses are by their side, then they are intending to go to Makkah. And if you (asws) see them to be riding the horses and their camels are by their sides, so they are intending to go to Al-Medina. Ali (asws) came up to them, and they were upon their camels, so Abu Sufyan said to Ali (asws), ‘O Ali (asws)! What do you (asws) want. That is where we are going, to Makkah. So leave and go to your (asws) companion (saww)’. Jibraeel followed them, and when they heard the galloping of his horse, they strived to move faster, and he kept following them. So when they moved, they said, ‘It is the army of Muhammad (saww) which is coming’. Abu Sufyan entered Makkah and informed them of the news. The shepherds and the woodcutters came. So they entered Makkah. They said, ‘We saw the army of Muhammad (saww)!’ All of them left. Abu Sufyan descended at Makkah and followed their footsteps horse to the horse. The people of Makkah came and addressed Abu Sufyan and reproached him. And the Prophet (saww) moved and the flag was with Ali (asws) and he (asws) was in front of him (saww). So when he (asws) came up with the flag while moving in front and when they reached ‘Al-Uqba’, and the people saw him (asws), Ali (asws) called out: ‘O you people! This is Muhammad (saww). He (saww) never died and he (saww) was never killed!’ So the one who had said, ‘He (saww) is mocking us and we have been defeated’ (Abu Bakr or Umar)’, said, ‘This is Ali (asws) and flag is in his (asws) hands’, until the Prophet (saww) moved towards them, and the women of the Helpers were in their courtyards and on the doorways of their houses, and the men came out to him (saww) returning from their flight and escape. The women of the Helpers had scratched their faces, and spread their hair, and placed dust upon their foreheads, and had torn the sides of their dresses, and tied their abdomens for (the grief for) Prophet (saww). So when he (saww) saw them, he (saww) said good things for them and told them to cover themselves up and enter their respective houses. And he (saww) said: ‘Allah (azwj) Promised me (saww) that He (azwj) would Make His (azwj) Religion to prevail over all the Religions’. And Allah (azwj) Revealed unto Muhammad (saww): “[3:144] Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least”, the Verse.",

He (saww) said; ‘Bring me a man who can take me (saww) via a different road to this one. So they came with a man from Muzaynat or from Juhaynat. He (saww) asked him, but he did not agree. So he (saww) said; ‘Bring to me (saww) a man other than him’. So they came with another man from Muzaynat, or from Juhaynat. He said, ‘I remember it.

The cavalry of the Helpers, Al-Aws, and Al-Khazraj initiated the advance, and they were one thousand eight hundred of them. So when they descended to Al-Hudaybiyya, there was a woman who had her son with her at Al-Quleyb. So her son ran away. So when she established that it was the Rasool Allah (saww), she screamed, ‘These are Al-Sa’ibun, there is no problem to you from them’. The Rasool Allah (saww) came up to her and commanded her to draw a bucket of water. The Rasool Allah (saww) took it. He (saww) drank, and washed his (saww) face. She took its remaining bit and returned it back in the well. That well still has water until this time. And the Rasool Allah (saww) came out, and the Polytheists sent to him (saww) Aban Bin Saeed with some horsemen in front of them. Then they sent Al-Hulays, so he saw the animals being prepared for sacrifice. He returned and did not come to the Rasool Allah (saww), and said to Abu Sufyan: ‘ By Allah (azwj), it was not this that we agreed upon, to return the sacrifices from its place’. He said, ‘Be quiet! For you are only a Bedouin’. He said, ‘But, by Allah (azwj), stay away from Muhammad (saww) and what he (saww) wants, or else I shall revolt among Al-Ahabeysh’. He said, ‘Keep quiet until we take an agreement from Muhammad (saww)’. So they sent to him (saww) Urwat Bin Masoud and he had gone to the Qureysh regarding the people whom Al-Mugheira Bin Soh’ba had killed when they had gone with him from Al-Taef, and they used to be businessmen. So he (al-Mughirah) killed them and had come with their wealth to the Rasool Allah (saww). So the Rasool Allah (saww) had refused to accept it and said; ‘This is treachery, and we (saww) have no need with regards to it’. They sent him so he said, ‘O Rasool Allah (saww), this is Urwat Bin Masoud who has come to you, and he magnifies the sacrifices’. He (saww) said: ‘Make him stand here’. They brought him to stand. He said, ‘O Muhammad (saww), why have you (saww) come?’ He (saww) said: ‘I (saww) have come to circumambulate (Tawaaf) the House, and perform Sa’ee between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, and sacrifice this camel and leave its meat for you’. He said, ‘No, I swear by al-laat and al-uzza, a person like you (saww) should not be sent back from what he has come for. If your (saww) people bind you (saww) to Allah (azwj) and the mercy, to enter their city without their permission, and cut-off their relationships, and make enemies to go against them’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘I (saww) will not do it until I (saww) enter the city’. And when Urwat Bin Masoud was speaking with the Rasool Allah (saww), he was holding his beard, and Al-Mugheira was standing near to his head. So he hit him by his hand and said, ‘Who is this, O Muhammad (saww)! So he (saww) said: ‘This is the son of your brother, Al-Mugheira’. He said, ‘O treachery! By Allah (azwj), I did not come here except for the reconciliation with you (saww)’. So he returned to them and said to Abu Sufyan and his companions, ‘No, by Allah (azwj), a person like Muhammad (saww) should not be turned back from what he has come for’. So they sent to him (saww) Suhail Bin Amro and Huweytab Bin Abdul Uzza. So the Rasool Allah (saww) commanded for the sacrificial animals to be spread out in front of their eyes. He said, ‘Why have you (saww) come here?’ He (saww) said: ‘For circumambulation of the House, and the Sa’ee between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, and sacrifice the animals and leave their meat between you’. If your (saww) people bind you (saww) to Allah (azwj) and the mercy from entering their city without their permission, and cut-off their relationships, and make their enemies to go against them’. He (asws) said; ‘The Rasool Allah (saww) refused the two of them, except that he (saww) would enter it. And the Rasool Allah (saww) had intended to send Umar to them. So he said, ‘O Rasool Allah (saww), my relatives are few, and I am among them of the status that you (saww) know about (a humiliating one). You (saww) should send Usman Bin Affan’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) sent for him and said, ‘Go to your people from the Believers. Give them the good news of what my (saww) Lord (azwj) has Promised me (saww) of the victory over Makkah’. So when Usman went, he met Aban Bin Saeed. So he delayed the camel and made room for Usman to ride with him. Usman entered (Makkah) and there was a skirmish. So Suhail Bin Amro seated himself in the presence of the Rasool Allah (saww), and Usman sat in the army of the Polytheists. And the Rasool Allah (saww) got the Muslims to pledge their allegiances and tap one by his hand upon the other and Muslims said: ‘How good of Usman that he has circumambulated the House and performed Sa’ee between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa and be lawful (out of Ihraam)’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘He did what he had to do’. So when Usman came, the Rasool Allah (saww) said to him; ‘Did you circumambulate the House?’ He said, ‘I could not circumambulate the House whilst the Rasool Allah (saww) had not circumambulated it’. Then he mentioned the story and what had happened’. So he (saww) said to Ali (asws): ‘Write – In the Name of Allah (azwj), the Beneficent, the Merciful’. Suhail said, ‘I don’t know what the Beneficent, the Merciful is except that I think this is the one at Al-Yamama. But, write as we write – ‘By Your (azwj) Name, our Allah (azwj)’. He (saww) said; ‘And write this – What has been agreed upon by the Rasool Allah (saww) and Suhail Bin Amro’. So Suhail said, ‘What are we fighting you (saww) for, O Muhammad (saww)?’ So he (saww) said; ‘I (saww) and the Rasool Allah (saww) and I (saww) am Muhammad bin Abdullah (saww)’. So the people said: ‘You (saww) are the Rasool Allah (saww)’. He said, ‘Write – Write that this is what has been agreed upon by Muhammad Bin Abdullah (saww)’. So the people said: ‘You (saww) are the Rasool Allah (saww)’. And what was in the agreement that – ‘The one who was from us, if he were to come to you, shall be returned back to us and the Rasool Allah (saww) will not keep him unwillingly from his religion, and the one who comes to us from you will not be returned back to you’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said; ‘There is no need for us regarding them, and they should be allowed to worship Allah (azwj) among you openly, not in secret, and be allowed to exchange gifts between Al-Medina to Makkah’. And there was not agreement more magnificent in Blessings than it for it made Al-Islam to almost take over the people of Makkah. So Suhail Bin Amro struck his hand upon his son Abu Jandal, so he said, ‘The first of what we have agreed with you’. The Rasool Allah (saww) said: ‘Have I (saww) applied the agreement upon anything yet?’ He said, ‘O Muhammad (saww)! You (saww) are not a traitor’. So he went with Abu Jandal’. So he said, ‘O Rasool Allah (saww), you (saww) are handing me over to him?’ He (saww) said: ‘And I (saww) did not set any conditions for you’. And said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Make a way out for Abu Jandal!’",

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, from Ibn Fazzaal, from Dawood Bin Abu Yazeed and he is Farqad, from Abu Yazeed Al-Hammaar, who has said the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) having said that: ‘Allah (azwj) Sent four Angels (to Prophet Ibrahim (as)) for the destruction of the people of Lut (as) – Jibraeel (as), and Mikaeel (as), and Israfeel (as), and Karoubeel (as) and they had obscured their faces. They greeted him (as). He (as) did not recognise them and saw them as good persons. So he (as) said (to himself (as)), ‘No one shall attend to them except for myself personally’, and he (as) was a kind host. So he grilled a calf for them until it was well done, then placed it near to them. So when he (as) placed it in front of them, “[11:70] But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it, he deemed them strange and conceived fear of them”. So when Jibraeel (as) saw that, he (as) removed the turban from his (as) face and from his (as) head. Ibrahim (as) recognised him (as). He (as) said: ‘You (as) are he (as)!’ He (as) said: ‘Yes’, and his (as) wife passed by and he (as) gave her (as) the good news of Is’haq (as), and after Is’haq (as) of Yaqoub (as). So she (as) said what Allah (azwj) has Stated, and they (as) answered her (as) with what is in the Mighty Book. So Ibrahim (as) said to them: ‘What have you (as) come for?’ They (as) said to him (as): ‘For the destruction of the people of Lut (as)’. So he (as) said to them (as): ‘Suppose there were a hundred Believers among them, would you (as) destroy them?’ Jibraeel (as) said: ‘No’. He (as) said: ‘If there were fifty?’ He (as) said: ‘No’. He (as) said, ‘If there were thirty?’ He (as) said; No’. He (as) said: ‘If there were twenty?’ He (as) said: ‘No’. He (as) said: ‘if there were ten?’ He (as) said; ‘No’. He (as) said: ‘If there were five?’ He (as) said: ‘No’. He (as) said: ‘If there was one?’ He (as) said: ‘No’. “[29:32] He said: Surely in it is Lut. They said: We know well who is in it; we shall certainly deliver him and his followers, except his wife; she shall be of those who remain behind”. Then they (as) left. And Al-Hassan Al-Askary Abu Muhammad (asws) said, and I don’t know whether it is the speech except that it has been preserved: ‘And it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[11:74] he began to plead with Us for Lut’s people”. So they (as) came to Lut (as) whilst he (as) was in his (as) farm near the city. So they (as) greeted him (as) whilst they (as) had obscured their (as) faces. So when he (as) saw them to be as good persons clad in white turbans and white robes, he (as) said to them (as): ‘Lodging?’ They (as) said: ‘Yes’. So he (as) led them (as) and they (as) walked behind him (as). He (as) regretted having offered lodging to them (as) and said (to himself (as)): ‘What shall I (as) do when I (as) come to my (as) people and I recognise them?’ So he (as) turned towards them (as) and said: ‘You (as) have come to evil creatures of Allah (azwj)’. And Jibraeel (as) had said: ‘We (as) will not make haste against them until he (as) testifies by three testimonies’. So Jibraeel (as) said (to himself (as)): ‘This is one testimony’. Then they (as) walked for a while, then he (as) turned towards them and said: ‘You (as) have come to evil creatures of Allah (azwj)’. So Jibraeel (as) said (to himself (as)): ‘These are two’. Then they (as) went, so when they reached the gate of the city, he (as) turned towards them (as) and said; ‘You (as) have come to evil creatures of Allah (azwj)’. So Jibraeel (as) said (to himself (as)): ‘These are three’. Then he (as) entered (the city) and they (as) entered with him (as). So when his (as) wife saw them (as) of good built she climbed on top of the roof of the house and whistled to the people. So when they did not hear her, she raised smoke. So when they saw the smoke they came rushing to the door. She came down to them and said, ‘He (as) has such people with him (as) that I have not seen such beauty ever better than theirs. They came to the gate, so when Lut (as) saw them, he (as) said: ‘O people! Fear Allah (azwj) and do not harass regarding my (as) guests. Is there no man with guidance among you? These are my (as) (community’s) daughters. They are cleaner for you, so call them to the Permissible’. They said, ‘You (as) are aware that there is no right for us regarding your daughters, and you (as) well know what we want’. So he (as) said; ‘If I (as) had strength or support I (as) would have resorted to a strong corner’. So Jibraeel (as) said (to himself (as)): ‘If only he (as) knew how much strength he (as) had’. So they spoke a lot until they (as) entered the house’. He (asws) said: ‘Jibraeel (as) shouted: ‘O Lut (as)! Call them to enter the house’. So when they entered, Jibraeel (as) pointed by his (as) finger around them, so their eyesight was lost and it is His (azwj) Words: “[54:37] but We blinded their eyes”. Then Jibraeel (as) called out: ‘We (as) have been Sent to destroy you all’. So he (as) said: ‘O Jibraeel (as), hurry up’. So he (as) said: ‘Their Promised time is the morning. Is not the morning yet?’ He (asws) said; ‘So he (Jibraeel (as)) commanded him to carry with him those who were with him (as) except for his (as) wife. Then Jibraeel (as), by his (as) wings, uprooted from the seventh firmament, then raised it until the inhabitants of the sky heard the barking of the dogs and the crowing of the roosters. Then he (as) overturned it, and rained upon it and upon the surrounding areas of the city, stones of clay’.",

Ibn Mahboub, from Hisham Bin Salim, from Abu Hamza, from Saeed Bin Al-Musayyab who said: I asked Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws), ‘How old was Ali (asws) on the day he (asws) became a Muslim?’ So he (asws) said: ‘What? Was he (asws) an infidel ever? But rather, when Allah (azwj) Sent His (azwj) Messenger (saww), Ali (asws) was ten years old, and he (asws) was never an infidel on that day, and he (asws) had believed in Allah (azwj), and in His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and preceded all of the people to the faith by Allah (azwj) and by His (azwj) Messenger (saww) and to the Prayer by three years’. And the first Prayer that he (asws) Prayed with the Rasool Allah (saww) was Al-Zohr (Midday) of two cycles and that is what Allah (azwj) Blessed and High had Obligated it as upon the one who became a Muslim at Makkah – two cycles, two cycles, and the Rasool Allah (saww) had Prayed two cycles at Makkah, and Ali (asws) had Prayed it with him (saww) as two cycles for a period of ten years until the Rasool Allah (saww) migrated to Al-Medina, and left Ali (asws) behind regarding the matters which no one part from him (asws) could have dealt with. And the going out of the Rasool Allah (saww) from Makkah was during the first of the Rabbi-ul-Awwal, and that was the day of Thursday on the thirteenth year from the Mab’as (Declaration of Prophet-hood), and journeyed to Al-Medina over twelve nights from the Month of Rabbi Ul-Awwal with the setting of the sun. So he (saww) descended at Quba, so he (saww) Prayed Al-Zohr two cycles, and Al-Asr two cycles. Then he (saww) did not cease to stay there, awaiting Ali (asws). He (saww) Prayed five Prayers of two cycles, two cycles. And he (saww) stayed at (the house of) Amro Bin Awf for about ten days. They were saying to him (saww), ‘Stay with us, so we will build for you (saww) house and a Masjid’. So he (saww) said; ‘No. I (saww) am awaiting Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws), and have ordered him (asws) to meet me (saww), and will not settle in a house until Ali (asws) comes, and he (asws) will not be long, Allah (azwj) Willing. So Ali (asws) came to the Prophet (saww) at the house of Amro Bin Awf and stayed with him (saww). Then the Rasool Allah (saww), when Ali (asws) arrived to him (saww), transferred from Quba to the Clan of Saalim Bin Awf, and Ali (asws) was with him (saww), on the Day of Friday at sunrise. So they drew a boundary for him (saww) for a Masjid, and established its Qiblah (direction of Prayer). He (saww) Prayed with them the Friday Prayer of two cycles, and preached them two sermons. Then he (saww) went to Al-Medina upon the she-camel which he (saww) had come upon, and Ali (asws) was with him (saww), not separating from him (saww), walking with him (saww) step by step. And there was no neighbourhood from the neighbourhoods of the Helpers which Rasool Allah (saww) passed by except that they stood up for him (saww) asking him (saww) to descend to them. He (saww) would say to them; ‘Make way for the she-camel for it is under instructions (of where to go). So it went and the Rasool Allah (saww) had freed its reins until it ended up at the place which you see’, and he (asws) gestured by his (asws) hands to the door of the Masjid of the Rasool Allah (saww) by which the funeral Prayers are performed. He (asws) said: ‘So it paused at it and knelt, and placed itself upon the ground. So the Rasool Allah (saww) descended, and Abu Ayub welcomed him (saww) to the extent that he carried his (saww) saddle bag and made him (saww) to enter his house. And the Rasool Allah (saww) and Ali (asws) stayed with him until they built for him (saww), his (saww) Masjid, and built for him (saww) his (saww) house, and a house for Ali (asws). So they two of them (asws) transferred to their (asws) houses’. So Saeed Bin Al-Musayyab (the narrator) said to Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws), ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), Abu Bakr was with the Rasool Allah (saww) when he (saww) arrived at Al-Medina. So when did he separate from him (saww)?’ So he (asws) said: ‘Abu Bakr was with him (saww) when the Rasool Allah (saww) proceeded to Quba, and he (saww) decided to wait for Ali (asws). So Abu Bakr said to him (saww), ‘Come with us to Al-Medina, for the people would rejoice at your (saww) arrival there and are eager to welcome you (saww). So come with us and do not stay over here waiting for Ali (asws), from what I can see, it would take him (asws) a month to come to you (asws)’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) said to him: ‘Never! He (asws) will not be long, and I (saww) will not move until my (saww) cousin (asws), and my (saww) brother (asws) for the sake of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the most beloved to me (saww) of my (saww) Family comes over, for he (asws) saved me (saww) from the Polytheists by being in my (saww) place’. He (asws) said; ‘So Abu Bakr was angry and was disgusted by it, and envy for Ali (asws) entered into him due to that, and that was the first enmity initiated from him to the Rasool Allah (saww) with regards to Ali (asws), and the first of his opposition to the Rasool Allah (saww). So he went until he entered Al-Medina, and left behind the Rasool Allah (saww) at Quba waiting for Ali (asws)’. (The narrator) said, ‘I said to Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws), ‘So when did the Messenger (saww) get Fatima (asws) married to Ali (asws)?’ He (asws) said: ‘At Al-Medina, a year after the Migration, and she was in her (asws) ninth year’. Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn (asws) said: ‘And there was no birth to the Rasool Allah (saww) from Khadija (as) upon the nature of Al-Islam except for Fatima (asws), and Khadija (as) had passed away a year before the Migration, and Abu Talib (as) had passed away a year after her (as) passing away. So when the two of them (as) passed away, the Rasool Allah (saww) got tired of staying at Makkah, and was overcome by intense grief and sympathised with himself (saww) from the infidels of Qureysh. He (saww) informed Jibraeel (as) about that, so Allah (azwj) Revealed unto him (saww): “Go out from the town where (its) people are unjust and Migrate to Al-Medina, for today there is no helper for you (saww) at Makkah, and establish a war against the Polytheists”. So the Rasool Allah (saww) heeded that and directed himself (saww) to Al-Medina’. So I (the narrator) said to him (asws), ‘So when was the Salat became Obligatory upon the Muslims in the form that they are Praying today?’ He (asws) said: ‘At Al-Medina when the Call was made apparent, and Al-Islam was strong, and Allah (azwj) Decreed Al-Jihaad upon the Muslims, and the Rasool Allah (saww) increased in the Prayer, seven cycles – two cycles in Al-Zohr, and two cycles in Al-Asr, and one cycle in Al-Maghrib, and two cycles in Al-Isha, and accepted Al-Fajr upon what it had been Obligated in order to expedite the descent of the Angels of the day from the sky and to expedite that rising of the Angels of the night to the sky. And the Angels of the night and the Angels of the day had been testifying with the Rasool Allah (saww) for Al-Fajr Prayer, so that is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[17:78] (the recital of) the Qur’an at dawn. Lo! (the recital of) the Qur’an at dawn is witnessed”, witnessed by the Muslims and witnessed by the Angels of the day and Angels of the night’.",

So he said to them, ‘If I were to turn it back from you, will you believe?’ They said, ‘Yes’. He (asws) said: ‘So it came, and he met it by his clothes and repulsed it. Then he followed it until it entered its cave, and he entered with it, and the people seated themselves at the entrance of the cave, and they were looking out for him and it looked as if he would never come out of it. He came out and he was saying, ‘This, this, and all this is from that. The son, of Ab’as thought, ‘I will not go out whilst my forehead is perspiring’. Then said, ‘Do you believe in me?’ They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘I will die on such a such a day, so when I am dead, bury me. There will come here donkeys among which will be a donkey with its tail cut off until it stands at my grave. So bring me out of my grave and ask me whatsoever you like’. So when he died, they buried him, and on that day the donkeys came and gathered, and they all came intending to exhume him. They said, ‘You all did not believe in him during his lifetime, so how will you now believe in him after his death? And if you were to exhume him it will be damnation for you, so leave him alone’. So they left him’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Hammad Bin Isa, from Ibrahim Bin Amro Al-Yamani, from Suleym Bin Qays Al-Hilali who said: I heard Salman Al-Farsy (ar) saying: ‘When the Rasool Allah (saww) passed away, and the people did what they did, and Abu Bakr and Umar, and Abu Ubeyda Bin Al-Jarrah disputed with the Helpers, they disputed with them by the ‘بِحُجَّةِ’ rights of Ali (asws). They said, ‘O group of Helpers! Qureysh are more deserving of the Command than you are because the Rasool Allah (saww) is from Qureysh and the Emigrant are from them. Allah (azwj) the High has Begun by them in His (azwj) Book and has Preferred them, and the Rasool Allah (saww) has said that the Imams (asws) are going to be from Qureysh’. Salman (ar) said. ‘So I (ar) came to Ali (asws) and he (asws) was washing (the body of) the Rasool Allah (saww). I informed him of what the people had done and I said, ‘At this time, Abu Bakr is upon the Pulpit of the Rasool Allah (saww), and by Allah (azwj), they are not happy to pledge their allegiances to him with one hand, they are pledging their allegiances by both, their right hands and their left’. So he (asws) said to me; ‘O Salman (ar)! Do you know the one who pledged his allegiance to him upon the Pulpit of the Rasool Allah (saww)?’ I (ar) said, ‘I (ar) do not know except that I (ar) saw in the shadow of the Clan of Sa’ada where the Helpers were disputing, and the one who was the first to pledged his allegiance to him was Basheer Bin Sa’ad, and Abu Ubeyda Bin Al-Jarrah, then Umar, then Saalim’. He (asws) said; ‘I (asws) did not ask you (ar) about this, but do you (ar) know the first one who pledged his allegiance when he ascended upon the Pulpit of the Rasool Allah (saww)?’ I (ar) said, ‘No, but I (ar) saw an old man leaning upon his walking stick, with a mark of prostration between his eyes due to the intensity of Al-Tashmir (prostrations) climb up to him and he was weeping and saying, ‘Praise be to Allah (azwj) Who did not Cause me to die from the world until I saw you in this place. Extend your hand’. So he extended his hand, and he pledged his allegiance to him. Then he descended and went out from the Masjid’. So Ali (asws) said; ‘Do you know who he was?’ I said, ‘No, but his speech had displeased me, as if he was gloating at the passing away of the Prophet (saww)’. So he (asws) said; ‘That was Iblees (la), may Allah (azwj) Curse him (la). The Rasool Allah (saww) informed me (asws) that Iblees (la) and the chiefs of his (la) companions witnessed the Messenger (saww) establishing me (asws) to the people at Ghadeer Khumm by the Command of Allah (azwj), so he (saww) told them that I (asws) was higher to them than their own selves and commanded them that those who were present should make it reach to the absentees. So the devils and the castaways companions of his (la) turned towards Iblees (la) and said, ‘This community is a Blessed community and is infallible, and there is neither for you (la) nor for us (la) a way against them, for they have come to know their Imam (asws), and their shelter after their Prophet (saww). So Iblees (la) , may Allah (azwj) Curse him (la) went away bleak and in grief. And the Messenger (saww) informed me (asws) that when he (saww) passes away, the people would be pledging their allegiances to Abu Bakr in the shade of the Clan of Sa’ada after their quarrelling, then they would be coming to the Masjid, so the first one who would be pledging his allegiance upon my (saww) Pulpit would be Iblees (la) may Allah (azwj) Curse him (la) in the image of an old man with mark of prostration, saying such and such. Then he (la) will go out and gather his (la) Satans and devils and excitedly say to them, ‘All of you (la) thought that there was no way for me (la) against them, so how do you (la) see what I (la) have done with them, to the extent that they had left the Command of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and being obedient to Him (azwj), and what the Rasool Allah (saww) has commanded them for’.",

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Suleyman, from Abdullah Bin Muhammad All Yamani, from Masma’a Bin All Hajjaj, from Sabbah Al-Haza’a, from Sabbah Al-Muzny, who has narrated from Jabir the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) has said; ‘When the Rasool Allah (saww) grabbed the hand of Ali (asws) on the Day of Al-Ghadeer, Iblees (la) screamed in his (la) army a loud scream. So there did not remain anyone from among them, either in the land or in the sea except that he came to him (la). So they said, ‘O our chief and our master, what was that shriek which we heard which was so frightening that you (la) have never screamed like this before’. So he (la) said to them, ‘It was the action of this Prophet (saww), if acted upon, no one would disobey Allah (azwj) ever’. So they said, ‘O our chief, you (la) dealt with Adam (as)’. So when the hypocrites said, ‘He (saww) speak out of desires’, and one of them two (Abu Bakr and Umar) said to his companion, ‘Did you see his (saww) turn in his (saww) head as if he (saww) is a mad man?’ (By this) meaning the Rasool Allah (saww), Iblees (la) screamed with a scream of pleasure. So his (la) friends gathered. So he (la) said, ‘But, do you know that I (la) dealt with Adam (as) beforehand?’ They said, ‘Yes’. He (la) said, ‘Adam (as) set aside the Covenant and did not blaspheme with the Lord (azwj), and these ones have set aside the Covenant and blasphemed against the Rasool Allah (saww)’. So when the Rasool Allah (saww) passed away and the people established someone other than Ali (asws), Iblees (la) wore a crown of the king and established a pulpit and sat upon the cushion, and gathered his (la) cavalry and his (la) infantry. Then he (la) said to them, ‘Be delighted! Allah (azwj) will not be obeyed until the Imam (asws) makes a stand’. And Abu Ja’far (asws) recited: “[34:20] And certainly the Shaitan found true his conjecture concerning them, so they follow him, except a party of the believers”. Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘The explanation of this Verse came to the fore when the Rasool Allah (saww) passed away, and the conjecture from Iblees (la) where they said to the Rasool Allah (saww) that he (saww) speak out of desire, so Iblees (la) conjectured about them with a conjecture and they made his (la) conjecture to come true’.",

Our condition changed as it sometimes does, so supplicate to Allah (azwj) to return that state to us’. So he (asws) said: ‘What is it that you want? To become kings? Would you be satisfied to become like Tahir and Harsama, and they are opposed to what you are upon?’ I said, ‘No, by Allah (azwj), it would not satisfy me that there should be for me the whole world and whatever is in it of the gold and the silver, whilst I am upon the opposite to what I am upon at present (Al-Wilayah). He (asws) said; ‘So the one who is contented among you, should be thankful to Allah (azwj). Allah (azwj) is Saying: “[14:7] If you are grateful, I would certainly give to you more”. And the Glorious and High Said: “[34:13] give thanks, O family of Dawood! and very few of My servants are grateful”. And think good with Allah (azwj), for Abu Abdullah (asws) used to say; ‘The one who thinks about Allah (azwj), Allah (azwj) would also Mention him (Reward him), and the one who is happy with a little from the sustenance, Allah (azwj) would Accept even small amount of deeds. And the one who is happy with a small amount of Permissible, his expenses would be light and his family would enjoy, and Allah (azwj) would Show him the sicknesses of the world and its cure and Bring him out from it safely to the House of Peace’. Then said; ‘What is the action of Ibn Qayama?’ I said, ‘By Allah (azwj), he (does not) meet us in a goodly manner’. So he (asws) said: ‘And which thing prevents him from that?’ Then he (asws) recited this Verse: “[9:110] The building which they have built will ever continue to be a source of disquiet in their hearts, except that their hearts get cut into pieces”. Then he (asws) said: ‘Do you know what was it that confused Ibn Qayama?’ I said, ‘No’. He (asws) said: ‘He chased Abu Al-Hassan (asws), so he came to him (asws) from his (asws) right, and from his (asws) left, and he wanted Masjid of the Prophet (saww).

So I said, ‘No, but the ones who said, ‘He (as) has been appointed for us, so we will follow him (as) in his (as) footsteps’.

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Al-Qasim Bin Muhammad, from Suleyman Bin Dawood Al-Munqary, from Hammaad, who has narrated the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) has said; ‘Luqman (as) said to his (as) son: ‘Whenever you travel with a group, take a lot of advice about them for your affairs and their affairs, and smile frequently in their faces, and be generous with your provisions. And if they call you, respond to them, and if they seek your support, help them. And be overcome them with three things – the length of silence, and the frequency of the Prayer, and generosity of the self with whatever is with you from the animal, or wealth, or provisions. And if they ask you to testify to ‘الْحَقِّ’ the truth, so testify for it, and exhaust your opinion for them if they consult you. Then do not advise them until you are sure about it and reconsider it, and do not answer in your advice until you stand regarding it, and sit, and sleep, and eat, and Pray, and you are utilising your thoughts and your wisdom with regards to your advice. So the one who does not refine his advice for the one who consulted him, Allah (azwj) Crucifies his opinion, and Removes from him the trust. And if you see your companions walking, so you should walk with them, and if you see them doing something, so do it with them, and if they give charity and give a loan, so give with them. And listen to the one who is older than you in age, and if he orders you and asks you, so say, Yes’, and do not say, ‘No’, for the ‘No’ is a fault and blameable. And if you are confused regarding your road, so stop and encamp, and if you are in doubt regarding the intended course, pause and plan. And if you see one person, do not ask him about your direction of road, and do not heed his guidance, for the one person in the wild is suspect for he could be an eye for the thieves, or he could be the Satan (la) who confused you. And be cautious of two persons as well, unless you can see what I (as) don’t, for the intellectual, when he sees something with his own eyes recognises the truth from it, and the witness can see what the absentee does not. O my son! And when the time of Salat comes up, so do not delay it for anything, and offer Salat and seek comfort from it for it is the Religion. And Pray in congregation even if there is pushing upon the head. And do not sleep upon your animal for that is injurious to its back, and that is not from the actions of the wise except if you are in a carriage and it is possible for you to stretch your joints. And when you come close to the destination, so descend from your animal and begin by feeding it before yourself. And when you intend to encamp, so it is upon you to remain in a land, which is good in colour, soft in soil, and abundance of grass. And if you encamp, so Pray two cycles before you sit down. And if you intend to fulfill your need (toilet), go far away. And when you embark (upon your journey) Pray two cycles, and say farewell to the land on which you spent time, and send greetings of peace upon it and upon its people, because for every patch of land has its inhabitants from the Angels. If you are able to, do not eat food until you begin by giving charity from it, so do it. And it is upon you to recite the Book of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic as long as you are riding. And it is upon you for the Glorification for as long as you are working. And it is upon you to supplicate for as long as you are alone. And beware of travelling in the first part of the night. And it is upon you to travel from the middle of the night to its end. And beware of raising your voice during your travel’.",

A number of our companions, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Khalid, from Al-Husayn Bin Yazeed Al-Nowfaly, from Ali Bin Dawood Al-Yaqouby, from Isa Bin Abdullah Al-Alawy who said: It has been narrated to me by Al-Asaydi and Muhammad Bin Basheer that Abdullah Bin Naf’a Al-Azraq used to say, ‘If only I knew someone between its (earth’s) diameter where my animal (ride) can reach to, who can debate with me that Ali (asws) killed the people of Naharwaan, and he (asws) was not unjust to them, I would ride over to him’ (to refute).

And have they (asws) ever been without a knowledgeable one?’ He said, ‘So who is their (asws) knowledgeable one today?’ It was said, ‘Muhammad (asws) Bin Ali (asws) Bin Al-Husayn Bin Ali (asws)’. He (the narrator) said, ‘So he rode over to him (asws) with the brave ones of his companions until he came up to Al-Medina. So he sought permission to see Abu Ja’far (asws). It was said to him (asws), ‘This is Abdullah Bin Naf’a’.

Abu Baseer Al-Kufy said to him (asws), ‘May I be sacrificed for you (asws), this one alleges that, ‘‘If only I knew someone between its (earth’s) diameter where my animal (ride) can reach to, who can debate with me that Ali (asws) killed the people of Naharwaan, and he (asws) was not unjust to them, I would ride over to him (to refute)’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said to him: ‘You think he has come to me (asws) for a debate?’ He said, ‘Yes’. He (asws) said: ‘O boy (servant), go out and unload his saddlebag, and tell him to come to us (asws) tomorrow’. He (the narrator) said, ‘So when it was the next day, Abdullah Bin Naf’a came with the brave ones of his companions, and Abu Ja’far (asws) sent a message to all the sons of the Emigrants and the Helpers and gathered them. Then he (asws) came out to the people wearing two alluring robes and faced the people as if he (asws) was the moon in orbit. So he (asws) said: ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj), the Awarder of the positions, and the Attribute of the attributes, and the Director of the directions. The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) “[2:255] slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His” up to the end of the Verse. ‘And I (asws) testify that there is no god except for Allah (azwj), One, with no associates to Him (azwj). And I (asws) testify that Muhammad (saww) is His (azwj) servant, Chosen by Him (azwj) and Guided by Him (azwj) to be on the Straight Path. The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) Who Honoured us (asws) with the Prophet-hood and Favoured us by Al-Wilayah. O group of the sons of the Emigrants and the Helpers! The ones among you who have merits regarding Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws), so he should stand and narrate them’. So the people stood up, so they enumerated those merits. Abdullah said, ‘I am a narrator of these merits from them, but, subsequently the disbelief took place after the appointment of the two judges’. Then they ended up with the merits in the Hadeeth of Khyber: ‘I (saww) shall give the flag tomorrow to a man who loves Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) Messenger (saww) love him (asws). An attacking one, not a fleeing one who will not return until Allah (azwj) Grants victory upon his (asws) hands’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said; ‘What do you say regarding this Hadeeth’. He said, ‘True. There is no doubt with regards to it, but disbelief took place afterwards’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said to him: ‘May your mother be bereft of you! Inform me (asws) about Allah (azwj) Loving Ali (asws) Bin Abu Talib (asws) on the Day He (azwj) Loved him (asws) and He (azwj) Knew that he (asws) would be killing the people of Nahrwan, or did He (azwj) not Know?’ Ibn Naf’a said, ‘Repeat that for me’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said to him: ‘Inform me (asws) about Allah (azwj), He (azwj) Loved Ali (asws) on the day that He (azwj) Loved him (asws), and He (azwj) Knew that he (asws) would be killing the people of Nahrwan, or did He (azwj) not Know?’ He said, ‘If I say, ‘No’, I would have blasphemed’. He (the narrator) said, ‘So he said, ‘He (azwj) had Known’. He (asws) said: ‘So did Allah (azwj) Love Ali (asws) to act in obedience to Him (azwj) or in disobedience to Him (azwj)?’ He (asws) said; ‘Upon his (asws) acting in obedience to Him (azwj)’. So Abu Ja’far (asws) said to him: ‘So stand up (and leave) for you have been defeated’. He stood up and he was saying, ‘Until the white thread becomes distinct from the black thread at dawn, Allah (azwj) Knows where He (azwj) should Make His (azwj) Message to be’.",

Then He (azwj) Made from His (azwj) ‘حُقُوقِهِ’ Rights, certain rights to be obligated for some people upon some other people. So He (azwj) Made it such that it obligates some of them for the others and does not obligate some except by the others. So the greatest of what Allah (azwj) has Necessitated from these rights is the rights of the governor upon the citizens and the rights of the citizens upon the governor, an obligation which Allah (azwj) has Obligated upon one and all. So He (azwj) has Made it to be a system for them and as strength for their Religion, and the establishment of the true Sunnah among them. The citizens will not be corrected except by the governor being correct, nor will the governor be correct except by the integrity of the citizens. So if the citizens fulfil the rights to the governor and the governor fulfils their rights as well, the truth will be strengthened between them. The manifesto of the Religion would be established, and the landmarks of justice would find fairness, and the Sunnah would flow smoothly. That would make life prosperous, and they would yearn for the survival of the government, and the enemies would despair from their ambitions. And if the citizens overcome the governor and the governor seeks to overcome them that are where the differences of speech emerge. The yearning of tyranny appears, and abundance of the lawlessness in the Religion, and the landmarks of the Sunnah are left. So they act by the desires, effects vanish, and illnesses of the souls abound. There is no fear of the penalties for infringement of the Laws, nor does confronting the falsehood seem great. So that is where the humiliation of the righteous and the honour for the evil ones is, and the ruination of the cities, and the greater the consequences will be for the servants in the presence of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic. So come, o you people, to the co-operation to the obedience to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and the establishment by His (azwj) Justice, and the loyalty to His (azwj) Covenant, and the fairness to Him (azwj) is all of His (azwj) Rights, for there is nothing more needed for the servants than for advising with regards to that, and the beautiful co-operation to Him (azwj), and there is no one who intensifies his passion for striving for the Pleasure of Allah (azwj) to be able to reach its deserving point of fulfilling the Rights to Allah (azwj). But, from the obligatory Rights of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, upon the servants is the advice to each other with maximum efforts, and the co-operation upon the establishment of the truth among them. Then there is person, no matter how great his status regarding the truth, how magnified his preference regarding the truth is, would not be needless from the co-operation upon what Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Burdened him with from His (azwj) Rights. And there is no person, no matter how low he is in the affairs, and the eyes are looking down upon him, can remain without being helped upon or given support. And the people of the merits and the people of the Favours are more frequently in need of that, and everyone is in need of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic equally’. A man from his (asws) army answered him (asws). No one knew who he was and it is said that he had never been seen in his (asws) army before that day, nor was he seen after it. So he stood up and beautifully Extolled Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by what the afflictions He (azwj) had Placed upon them, and His (azwj) Favours from the Obligation of His (azwj) rights against them, and accepted all what had been mentioned of the changing conditions with him (asws) and with them. Then said, ‘You (asws) are our Commander, and we are your (asws) citizens. It is by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Brought us out of the humiliation and it is by your (asws) strength that He (azwj) Freed His (azwj) servant from the chains. So choose for us, and we will go by your (asws) choice, and make a plan and we would go by your (asws) plan, for you (asws) are a truthful speaker, and the successful ruler, and the authorised king. It is not permissible for us to disobey you (asws) in anything, nor do we compare our knowledge with your (asws) knowledge. You (asws) are great in regard to that choice, in our eyes, and your (asws) virtues are majestic within us’. So Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him saying: ‘It is from the Rights that the one who Magnifies the Majesty of Allah (azwj) within himself and exalts His (azwj) position in his heart, everything else would seem little to him. And the one most deserving to be like that is the one to whom the Bounties of Allah (azwj) are great as well as His (azwj) Kind Favours to him, for no one would magnify the Bounties of Allah (azwj) except that the Rights of Allah (azwj) Increase upon him. And the lowest of the conditions of the governor in the presence of the righteous people is when he thinks of the love for pride and bases his affairs upon the arrogance, and I (asws) did not like to become lost in your thoughts that I (asws) would love the praise and listening to the praise. And I (asws) am not like that. Thanks be to Allah (azwj). And had I (asws) loved what you said, I (asws) would have abandoned it due to it lowering me (asws) for the Sake of Allah (azwj) that I (asws) should take to magnificence and greatness when He (azwj) is more deserving of it. Maybe the people consider it sweet to be praised after the affliction. So do not praise me (asws) with beautiful praises as it may take my (asws) soul out from being for the Sake of Allah (azwj), and the remainder of the rights which I (asws) have yet to fulfill and the obligations which I (asws) have yet to perform. So, do not speak to me (asws) as you speak to the tyrants, and do not have reservations from me (asws) like you have reservations in the presence of the unresponsive people, and do not flatter me (asws), and do not think that I (asws) consider it heavy regarding the right which is said to me (asws), or that I (asws) seek self-greatness, for it is not correct for me (asws). So the one who considers the rights to be a burden if they are told to him, or the justice if it is presented to him, it would become heavier for him to act in accordance with these two. So do not withhold from me (asws) speaking about the rights, or consultation with justice, for I (asws) not, with regards to myself (asws), above mistakes, nor do I (asws) feel secure from that in my (asws) deeds except if Allah (azwj) Suffices for myself (asws) in matter which He (azwj) has more Control over than what I (asws) have. But rather, I (asws) and you all are servants, belonging to the Lord (azwj). There is no lord apart from Him (azwj). He (azwj) Owns us what we do not own ourselves, and Took us out from what we used to be in to be in a situation which was correct for us. So He (azwj) Protected us after straying, by the Guidance. He (azwj) Gave us the vision after the blindness. So, the man who answered him (asws) before, answered him (asws), ‘By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are deserving of what I said. By Allah (azwj), you (asws) are more deserving than what I said, for His (azwj) Favours are such that we cannot deny, and Allah (azwj) Blessed and High has Burdened you (asws) with our citizens, and the Guardianship of our political affairs. So you (asws) have become (a representative of) our knowledge with which we can be guided by, and our Imam (asws) whom we follow, and every matter of yours (asws) is guidance, and every word of yours (asws) is educational. Our eyes have found delight with you (asws) in our lives, and our hearts are filled with bliss by you (asws), and we are amazed at the qualities, which are within you (asws) and our intellects are at a loss to describe. We are not saying to you (asws), ‘O you (asws) righteous Imam (asws) as a purification for you (asws), nor are we exaggerating in our intentions regarding our praising you (asws). And we are not becoming critical of your (asws) conviction, or the purity of your (asws) Religion, so we have no fear that you (asws) would innovate by the Bounties of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, or be tyrannical, or that arrogance should enter you (asws), but we are saying to you (asws) what we said in order to be closer to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic by revering you (asws), and Enhancing your (asws) merits, and appreciate the greatness of your (asws) command. So consider yourself (asws) and use, and give preference to the Command of Allah (azwj) over yourself (asws) and over us, for we are obedient with regards to whatever you (asws) order us for, and we submit to the commands along with that regarding what is beneficial for us’. Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) answered him, so he (asws) said: ‘And I (asws) am binding you in the Presence of Allah (azwj) to myself (asws) for your knowing that I (asws) am the guardian for your matters, for very shortly you will be gathered with me (asws). And I (asws) warn you of the Pausing in front of Him (azwj), and the Questioning about what we were in, then some of us will testify against the others, so do not testify today against what you will be testifying tomorrow, for there is nothing hidden from Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, nor is it permitted in His (azwj) Presence except for the good advice of the chests in all of the matters’. So the man answered him (asws), and it was said that the man was never seen again after this speech of his to Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), and he was bursting with emotion in his chest, and he spoke, and wailed which cut off his speech, and was anxious and choking, breaking his voice, being at the verge of collapse. So he Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), then pleaded before Him (azwj) of the horrors of what he had been cured of, from the great dangers, and the prolonged humiliation regarding the mischief to take place during his (asws) era, and the rebellions against him (asws) and the cutting off of what was from his (asws) government. Then he implored the matter to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic of the Bestowing of Favours on him (asws), and the Dispelling (dangers) from him (asws), and then Extolled Him (azwj) in a goodly manner. So he said, ‘O Lord (azwj) of the servants, and O Giver of tranquillity to the cities! How can we speak of Your (azwj) Grace, and how can we reach Your (azwj) Attributes from Your (azwj) Actions, and for me to reach the reality of the beauty of Your (azwj) Praise, or count the beauty of Your (azwj) Favours. So how can we, and it is due to you (asws) that the Bounties of Allah (azwj) have flowed towards us, and it is upon your (asws) hands that the causes of the good have arrived to us. Did you (asws) not become a sanctuary for the lowest of the low, and a saviour for the disobedient infidels? So by whom, except for the People (asws) of your (asws) Household, and by you (asws) that Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Took us out from horrors of those dangers, and by whom did he (azwj) Rescue us from the thrones of distress, and by whom except by you (asws) did Allah (azwj) Make apparent the landmarks of our Religion, and Corrected what was spoilt from our Religion until we came to be mentioned, after the tyranny. And our eyes were delighted with a prosperous life when you (asws) became our Guardian as a favour to us, and you (asws) struggled and fulfilled to us all of your (asws) promises, and stood by all of your (asws) oaths to us. So you (asws) were a witness for the ones who were absent from us, and a successor of the People (asws) of the Household for us. And you (asws) were the strength of our weak ones, and the wealth of our poor ones, and a pillar for our great ones. It was your (asws) justice that brought us together in the matters, and accommodated us regarding the truth by your (asws) patience. You (asws) were, for us a familiarity if we saw you (asws), and a tranquillity whenever we mentioned you (asws). So which is the good deed, which you (asws) did not perform, and which is the righteous deeds which you (asws) did not act upon? And had it not been for the matter which we fear for you (asws) from it reaching you, which our efforts could change, and our strengths could defend you (asws) from it, we would be permitted to sacrifice ourselves for your (asws) defence, and repulse it from you (asws) by ourselves and our sons, we would put ourselves and our sons before you (asws). And we would make this choice, and reduce its danger from you (asws), and we would stand in our efforts in an attempt to defend you (asws) from your (asws) enemies. But He (azwj) is an Authority, which cannot be stopped, and a Strength which cannot decline, and a Lord (azwj) Who cannot be overcome. So if he (azwj) was to Bestow a Favour to us by Bestowing upon you (asws) good health, and be Merciful towards us by Keeping you (asws) alive, and be Compassionate to us by Relieving you (asws) of these difficulties from your (asws) situation to Keep you (asws) safe for us, and remain with us in front of us, we would narrate appreciation to Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic for that, and Magnify Him (azwj), and Mention Him (azwj) constantly, and distribute half of our wealth as charity, and free half of our slaves, and narrate to Him (azwj) with humbleness in our selves, and be submissive in all of our affairs. And when He (azwj) Takes you to the Gardens, and Makes to Flow for you (asws) that which is inevitable, so no one would be able to change that which He (azwj) has Ordained, nor repulse from you (asws) His (azwj) Favours, nor will our hearts be opposed to that for that which He (azwj) has Chosen for you (asws) of what is with Him (azwj) over what you (asws) used to be in. But, we would weep if this authority (government) were to return back to humiliation, and for the Religion and the world to be consumed and we do not see for you (asws) a successor we can take our complaints to, nor a similar government we can have hope in establishing it’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, and Muhammad Bin Ali, together from ismail Bin Mahran, and Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Ahmad, from Ali Bin Al-hassan Al-Taymi, and Ali Bin Al-Husayn, from Ahmad Bin muhammad Bin Khalid, together from Ismail Bin Mahran, from Al-Munzar Bin Jayfar, from Al-Hakam Bin Zaheer, from Abdullah Bin Jareer Al-Abdy, from Al-Asbagh Bin Nubata who said: ‘There came to Amir-ul-Momineen (asws), Abdullah Bin Umar and a son of Abu Bakr, and Sa’d bin Abu Waqqas, seeking from him (asws) the preferential treatment for themselves. So he (asws) ascended the Pulpit, and the people turned their attention towards him (asws). So he (asws) said: ‘The Praise is due to Allah (azwj) to Whom belongs all Praise, and Who is extremely Generous. The descriptions do not fathom Him (azwj) nor is He (azwj) limited by the languages, nor can He (azwj) be understood by the wildest imaginations. And I (asws) testify that there is no god except Allah (azwj), One with no associates to Him (azwj), and that Muhammad (saww) is the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), a Prophet (saww) of Guidance and a place for the piety, and a Messenger (saww) of the Highest Lord (azwj) who (saww) came with the Truth from the Presence of the Truth, to warn by the Enlightening Quran and the Illuminating Proof. So he (saww) declared by the Manifest Book and passed away upon what the former Messengers (saww) had passed away. Having said that, O you people! Do not speak of the men who were immersed in the world, and acquired properties, and made canals to flow, and rode plenty of animals, and cLuthed themselves with soft cLuthing, for that would became a source of shame and ignominy for them if the Forgiver does not Forgive them. If I (asws) were to prevent them from what they used to be in (affluent lifestyle) and take them to what is necessary for them, they would lose all that and they would be saying that the son (asws) of Abu Talib (asws) has been unjust to us and has prohibited us and prevented us from our rights. So, Allah (azwj) is the Helper against the one who (Prays) in our direction (Qiblah), and eats the animals slaughtered by us, and believes by our Prophet (saww), and testifies to what we testify, and enters our Religion, we (asws) will apply upon him the Judgements of the Quran, and the Limits of Al-Islam. There is no preference for anyone over anyone else except by the piety. Indeed! The pious ones have the highest Rewards in the Presence of Allah (azwj) the High, and the best Recompense and the Return. Allah (azwj) did not Make the world to be for the pious ones as a form of Reward, and what is in the Possession of Allah (azwj) is better for the righteous. People of the religion of Allah (azwj)! Consider what you find in the Book of Allah (azwj) and what you leave in the presence of the Rasool Allah (saww) and what you have been striving by for the Sake of Allah (azwj), either by nobility, or by lineage, or by deeds, or by obedience, or devotion, and regarding what you were interested in. So rush to your destinations, may Allah (azwj) have mercy upon you, which you have been Commanded to construct. Assets, which will not spoil and will remain, and will not diminish. The dwellings to which you have received invitations for, and are being encouraged to acquire, and recommended to be interested in, and the Rewards are Made to be in His (azwj) Presence. So seek the completion of the Bounties of Allah (azwj) by the submission to His (azwj) Judgement, and the appreciation for His (azwj) Favours. The one, who is unhappy with this, is not from us (asws), nor is he to us (asws). The rulers who judge by the Judgement of Allah (azwj), without being anxious from that, those are the successful ones’. (And in another copy: ‘They are not anxious, and those are the ones who have no fear upon them, nor shall they grieve’). And he (asws) said: ‘And I (asws) will discipline you with my (asws) whip which I discipline my (asws) family with, so do not worry, and I (asws) will be striking you by my whip by which I (asws) establish the Limits of my (asws) Lord (azwj). So do not be scared. Do you want that I (asws) should strike you by my (asws) sword? But rather, I (asws) am more knowing of that which you want, and how to straighten your unevenness. But, I (asws) will not buy your correction in exchange for spoiling myself (asws). However, Allah (azwj) will Make a people to overcome you and will exact my (asws) Revenge from you all. So you will have no world that you can enjoy in, and no Hereafter that you can look forward to. Thus, remote and crushed are the companions of the blazing Fire’.",

Muhammad Bin Yahya, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Isa, and Abu Ali Al-Ashary, from Muhammad Bin Abdul Jabbar, together from Ali Bin Hadeed, from Jameel, from Zurara, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) said, ‘Humran asked him (asws), ‘May Allah (azwj) Make me to be sacrificed for you (asws)! If you (asws) were to narrate to us when this Matter (Al-Qaim (asws)) is to take place, it would make us happy’. He (asws) said: ‘O Humran! You have friends, and brothers, and people whom you know. There used to be a scholar in the past, and he had a son who was never interested in the knowledge of his father, and did not ask him about anything, and they had a neighbour who used to come over and ask him, and take (knowledge) from him. The death presented itself to the man, so he called his son and said, ‘O my son! You have kept yourself away from what was in my possession, and had very little interest in it, and you never used to ask me about anything, whilst I had a neighbour who used to come to me, and ask me, and take (knowledge) from me, and memorise it from me. So now if you ever need anything, go to him. He introduced his neighbour to him. The man died, and his son remained. The king of that era saw a dream, so he asked around for the man. It was said to him that he had died. So the king said, ‘Did he leave a son?’ It was said to him, ‘Yes, he left a son’. So he said, ‘Bring him to me’. They went to him in order to bring him to the king. The boy said, ‘By Allah (azwj), I do not know why the king has called me, and there is no knowledge with me, and if he were to ask me about something, I would be disgraced’. He remembered what his father has bequeathed to him, so he came to the man who used to take the knowledge from his father. He said to him, ‘The king has sent for me to ask me, and I do not know why he has sent for me, and my father had ordered me that I should come to you if I ever have a need for anything’. The man said, ‘But I know very well with regards to what he has sent for you. So, if I were to inform you, then whatsoever that Allah (azwj) Brings out to you, so it would be (divided) between you and me’. He said, ‘Yes’. He took an oath from him and made a binding agreement with the boy. He said, ‘He wants to ask you about a dream that he saw, as to which era it relates to? So you should say to him, ‘This is the era of the wolf’. The boy went to him, and the king said to him, ‘Do you know why I sent for you?’ He said, ‘You sent for me intending to ask me about a dream that you saw, as to which era it relates to’. The king said, ‘You speak the truth, so inform me as to which era it relates to’. He said to him, ‘The era of the wolf’. So he ordered for an award to be given to him, and the boy grabbed it and left to go to his house. He refused to be loyal to his companion and said (to himself), ‘I will not hand over this wealth, and will consume it until I die, and there is no need for me, nor will I ever have to ask him about anything similar to what I have already asked him’. So that (situation) prevailed for as long as Allah (azwj) Desired it to. Then the king saw (another) dream, so he sent for the boy. He regretted at what he had done and said, ‘By Allah (azwj), there is no knowledge with me that I can give, and I do not know how to deal with my companion, and I have betrayed him, and never apologised to him’. Then said, ‘Let me go to him in any case and present excuses to him, hopefully he will inform me’. So he came and said to him, ‘I have done what I have done, and never apologised to you for what happened between I and you, and that which was in my hands has gone, and I have now got a need from you’. So adjure me to Allah (azwj) and do not abandon me, and I am a reliable one for you, that nothing will be given to me except that it would be (divided) between you and me. And the king has sent for me and I do not know what he will be asking me’. So he said, ‘He intends to ask you about a dream he saw, as to which era it relates to, so say to him, ‘It is for the era of the ram’. So he went to the king who said, ‘Do you know why I have sent for you?’ He said, ‘You saw a dream and you want to ask me as to which era it relates to’. So he said to him, ‘You have spoken the truth, so tell me which era this is for?’ He said, ‘This is for the era of the ram’. So he ordered a reward for him. The boy grabbed it and left for his house, and he was pondering whether he should be loyal to his companion, or whether he should not be loyal to him. Sometimes he thought that he should do it, sometimes he thought that he should not do it. Then he said (to himself), ‘I will have no need for him anymore after this time ever’, and opted for the betrayal and leave the loyalty. So that (situation) prevailed for as long as Allah (azwj) Desired it to. Then the king saw (another) dream, so he sent for him. He regretted at what he had done regarding what was between himself and his companion and said (to himself), ‘I have betrayed him twice, how shall I face him, and there is no knowledge with me. Then he decided on going to the man, and came up to him. So he swore upon Allah (azwj) Blessed and High, and asked him to let him know and inform him, and that this time he would be loyal to him, and be a trustworthy to him, and said, ‘Do not leave me upon this condition, for I will not return to the betrayal, and will be loyal to you. So he took an agreement from him. He said, ‘He has called you to ask you about a dream he saw, as to which era it relates to. So when he questions you, inform him that it is for the era of the scale (balance)’. He (asws) said: ‘So he came up to the king who said to him, ‘Do you know why I have sent for you?’ He said, ‘You have seen a dream and intend to ask me as to which era it relates to’. He said, ‘You have spoken the truth, so tell me which era this is for?’ He said, ‘This is for the era of the scale’. So he ordered a reward for him. The boy grabbed the reward and went with it to the man and placed it in front of him and said, ‘I have come to you with whatever was given to me, so divided it equally’. So the scholar said to him, ‘The first period was like the era of the wolf, and you were from the wolves. And the second period was the era of the ram which thinks but does not do it, and similarly you were thinking about it but were not loyal. And this period is the era of the scale, and you were, with regards to it, upon the loyalty. So grab your wealth for I have no need for it’. And he returned it back to him’.",

He (asws) said: ‘When ascension took place with the Messenger (saww) of Allah (azwj), Jibraeel came up to him (saww) with Al-Buraaq (the ride). So he (saww) rode on it and came to Bayt Al-Maqdas (Jerusalem). So he (saww) met the ones whom he (saww) met from his (saww) brothers from the Prophets (as).

Jibraeel came to me (saww) with Al-Buraaq, so I (saww) rode upon it, and the sign of that is that I (saww) passed by the camels of Abu Sufyan being watered at the watering hole of the clan of so and so.

So some of them said to the others, ‘But rather he (saww) went to Syria whilst riding at speed whereas you have been to Syria and recognise it.

So when they were in the middle of that, Jibraeel came up to him (saww) and said: ‘O Rasool Allah (saww), this here is Syria which has been raised for you (saww)!’ So the Rasool Allah (saww) turned and visualised Syria, with its doors, and its markets, and its businessmen’. So he (saww) said: ‘Where are the questioners about Syria?’ So they said to him (saww), ‘It is so and so and so and so (Abu Bakr and Umar)’. So the Rasool Allah (saww) answered them with regards to all of what they asked from him (saww). Even then they did not believe from among them, except for a few, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Blessed and High: “[10:101] and signs and warners do not avail a people who would not believe”. Then Abu Abdullah (asws) said: ‘We (asws) seek Refuge with Allah (azwj) from disbelief in Allah (azwj) and in His (azwj) Rasool (saww). We (asws) believe in Allah (azwj) and in His (azwj) Messenger (saww)’.",

Ahmad Bin Muhammad bin Ahmad, from Ali Bin Al-Hasan Al-Taymi, from Muhammad Bin Abdullah, from Zurara, from Muhammad Bin Al-Fazeyl, from Abu Hamza who said: ‘I heard Abu Abdullah (asws) saying: ‘When the believers says to his brother, ‘Uff!’ he comes out from his guardianship. If he says, ‘You are my enemy’, one of the two has blasphemed, because Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Accept the deeds from anyone during the reproach of a Believer, and does not Accept from a Believer any deeds whilst he harbours evil in his heart against a Believer. If the covering is Lifted from the people, so they will see to the Means of what is between Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic and the Believers. Their necks would become submissive to the Believers, and their matters would become easier for them and they would be obedient to them. And if they were to look at the deeds rejected by Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, they would say, ‘Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic does not Accept the deeds from anybody’. And I (the narrator) heard him (asws) say to a man from the Shites: ‘You all are the good ones, and your women are the good ones. Every Believing woman is a beautiful Hourie, and every believing man is a truthful one’. He (the narrator) said, ‘And I heard him (asws) saying: ‘Our (asws) Shites would be the closest of the creatures to the Throne of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic on the Day of Judgement after us (asws). And there is no one from our (asws) Shites who stand to Pray except that the number of Angels equal to the ones opposed to him Pray for him in congregation for him until he is free from his Salat (Prayer). And the one from among you who Fasts will be enjoying in the Gardens of the Paradise, and the Angels prepare it for him until he breaks the Fast’. And I (the narrator) heard him (asws) saying: ‘You (Shites) are the people Greeted by the Greetings of Allah (azwj), and the people Impacted by the Mercy of Allah (azwj), and the people Guided by the Protection of Allah (azwj), and the people Invited by Allah (azwj) for being obedient to Him (azwj). There is no Accounting for you (Shites), and no fear, and no grief. You are all for the Paradise and the Paradise is for you all. Your names (titles) in our (asws) presence are, ‘the righteous’, and ‘the reformers’. And you are the people of the Pleasure of Allah (azwj), Him (azwj) being Pleased with you, and the Angels are your brothers in the good. So if you are striving, they supplicate for you, and if you are in neglect, they strive for you. And you are the best of the created beings. Your houses are gardens for your (living ones), and the graves are the garden for your (deceased). It is for the Paradise that you have been created, and it is in the Paradise that you will be Favoured by, and it is to the Paradise that you are travelling to’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ibn Abu Umeyr, from Hisham Bin salim, from Abu Ayyub Al-Khazzaz, from Abu Baseer, who has said the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) having said that: ‘Azar, the father of Ibrahim (as) was an astrologer for Nimrod (la) and he (la) never passed a law except after seeking his advice. So he looked at the stars one night, and in the morning he said to Nimrod (la), ‘I have seen something strange’. He (la) said, ‘And what is it?’ He said, ‘I saw a newborn being born in our land. Our destruction will be by his (as) hands. It will not be long after him (as) being conceived’. So he (la) was astounded by that and said, ‘Has the woman fallen pregnant with him (as) yet?’ He said, ‘Not yet’. So he (la) separated the women from the men. He (la) did not leave a single woman except that he (la) made her to be in the city, with no man being allowed to be alone with her. Azar copulated with his wife and Ibrahim (as) was conceived. He thought that he (as) might be the one. So he sent for the women from the midwives of that time, that if there is anything in her womb they should notify him. They examined her. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Made what was in her womb to be transferred to the back. So they said, ‘We did not see anything in her tummy’. And what was in his knowledge was that he (as) would be burnt by the fire, and did not know that Allah (azwj) the High would be Rescuing him (as)’. He (asws) said: ‘So when the mother of Ibrahim (as) gave birth to him (as), Azar wanted to go with him (as) to Nimrod (la) to be killed. So his wife said to him, ‘Do not go with your son (as) to Nimrod (la) for he (la) will kill him (as). I shall go with him (as) to one of the caves and leave him (as) there until his (as) death comes to him (as), and you will not become the one to have killed your own son’. So he said to her, ‘Take him (as)’. So she went with him (as) to a cave, then placed him (as) in it, and placed a rock to block the entrance of the cave. Then she left him (as). He (asws) said: ‘Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Made his (as) sustenance to be in his (as) thumb. He (as) would suck it and milk would flow from it. He (as) grew in a day like others grow in a week, and grew in a week like others grow in a month, and grew in a month like others grow in a year. So that situation remained for as long as Allah (azwj) Desired it to remain. Then his (as) mother said to his (as) father, ‘If you allow me, I shall go to that child’. So he allowed her. So she went there and there was Ibrahim (as). His (as) eyes lit up like two lanterns. She grabbed him (as) and pressed him (as) to her bosom, and fed him (as). Then she left him there. Azar asked her about him (as), so she said, ‘I have hidden (buried) him in the soil’. She waited, and she would come out for her need, and go to Ibrahim (as), hold him (as) to her bosom, feed him (as), and leave him (as). So when he (as) started moving, she would still come to him (as) and do as she had done before. So when she wanted to leave, he (as) grabbed her robe. She said to him (as), ‘What is the matter?’ He (as) said to her: ‘Take me (as) with you’. She said, ‘Not until your father orders me to’. He (asws) said: ‘The mother of Ibrahim (as) came to Azar. She related to him the story. He said to her, ‘Bring him (as) to me. Make him (as) to be seated upon the road, so when his (as) brothers pass by, make him (as) enter with them, and he (as) will not be noticed’. He (asws) said: ‘And the brothers of Ibrahim (as) used to carve the idols and would go with these to the markets and sell them. So she went to him (as), and came with him (as) until she made him (as) to sit upon the road. And his (as) brothers passed by, he (as) entered with them. So when his (as) father saw him (as), he was overwhelmed with the love for him (as). And so the situation remained as such for as long as Allah (azwj) Desired it to’. He (asws) said; ‘One day from the days during which, his (as) brothers were in the middle of carving the idols, Ibrahim (as) took the tool, and took a piece of wood, and carved such an idol from it the like of which they had never seen before at all. So Azar said to his (as) mother, ‘I hope that we receive good luck from the blessings of this son (as) of yours’. He (asws) said; ‘So when they were in the middle of that, Ibrahim (as) grabbed hold of the tool and broke the idol which he (as) had carved. So his (as) father got scared and was overcome with severe panic. He said to him (as), ‘What would you (as) have done with it?’ Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘And what would you have done with it?’ Azar said, ‘People would have worshipped it’. So Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Are you worshipping what you yourself have carved?’ So Azar said to his (as) mother, ‘This is the one due to whom our kingdom would go away, by his (as) hands’.",

Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Abu Nasr, from Aban Bin usman, from Hujr, who has said the following: Abu Abdullah (asws) has said; ‘Ibrahim (as) opposed his (as) people, and faulted their gods until he was brought to Nimrod (la) to contend with him (la). So Ibrahim (as) said: “[2:258] My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: So surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east, then make it rise from the west; thus he who disbelieved was confounded; and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people”. And Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘He (as) faulted their gods, “[37:88] And he glanced a glance at the stars [37:89] Then said: Lo! I feel sick!” Abu Ja’far (asws) said: ‘By Allah (azwj), he (as) was not sick, nor did he (as) lie. So when they turned away from him (as) to attend to their festivities, Ibrahim (as) came to their gods with an axe and broke them, except for the big one of theirs, and placed the axe around its neck. They came back to their gods and saw what had happened to them, so they said, ‘No, by Allah (azwj), no one has the audacity to break these except for the young man (as) who had faulted these and keeps away from them’. So they did not find for him (as) a manner of killing more severe than the fire. They gathered the firewood, and fuelled it. When it came to the day in which he (as) was to be burnt, Nimord (la) and his (la) army came out, and there had been built for them a building to look at him (as) from above to see how the fire would grab hold of him (as). And they placed Ibrahim (as) in a catapult, and the earth cried out: ‘O Lord (azwj)! There is none upon my back who worships You (azwj) apart from him (as) who is being burnt by the fire’. The Lord (azwj) Said: “If he (as) supplicates to Me (azwj), I (azwj) shall Suffice for him (as)’. Aban has mentioned, from Muhammad Bin Marwan, from the one who reported it, from Abu Ja’far (asws) that: ‘The supplication of Ibrahim (as) on that day was: ‘O One! O Everlasting! O Everlasting! O One Who does not beget nor is He Begotten, and there is none comparable to Him!’ Then he (as) said: ‘I (as) rely upon Allah (azwj)’. So the Lord (azwj) Blessed and High Said: “I (azwj) shall Suffice for you (as)”. So the fire said: ‘Make me to be cold’. He (asws) said: ‘The teeth of Ibrahim chattered from the cold until Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “Safety upon Ibrahim (as)”. And Jibraeel descended, and he was seated with Ibrahim (as) talking to him (as) in the fire. Nimrod (la) said, ‘When you take a god, you should take a god similar to that of the God of Ibrahim (as)’. He (asws) said; ‘So a great one from their great ones said, ‘It was I who intended that the fire should not burn him (as)’. So a huge flame shot out from the fire at him until it incinerated him’. He (asws) said: ‘Lut (as) believed in him (as), and went out as an emigrant to Syria – him (as), and Sarah (as) and Lut (as)’.",

        "englishText": "559. Ali Bin Ibrahim, from his father, and a number of our companions, from Sahl Bin Ziyad, together from Al-Hassan Bin Mahboub, from Ibrahim Bin Abu Ziyad Al-Karkhy who said: ‘I heard Abu Abdullah (asws) saying that: ‘Ibrahim (as) was born at Kowsy Ruba, and his (as) father was from its inhabitants, and the mother of Ibrahim (as), and the mother of Lut (as) were Sara and Warqa’ (and in another copy ‘Ruqayya’), and were sisters, and they were both the daughters of Lahij (as). And Lahij (as) was a Prophet (as), a Warner, but was not a Messenger (as). And Ibrahim (as) was, in his (as) youth, upon the nature which Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Created, to the extent that Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Guided him (as) to His (azwj) Religion, and Chose him (as). And he (as) married Sara, the daughter of Lahij (as), the daughter of his (as) maternal aunt. And Sara was the owner of a lot of assets, and vast lands, and of good financial condition, and Ibrahim (as) was the owner of all what she had owned. So he (as) managed it, and corrected the affairs, and increased the assets and plantations considerably, to the extent that he (as) became the most affluent man in the land of Kowsy Ruba. And when Ibrahim (as) broke the idols, Nimrod (la) ordered his (as) capture, and they built a platform, and gathered the firewood around it and ignited the fire, and threw Ibrahim (as) via a catapult to be burnt by it. Then they relaxed until the fire burnt out. Then they looked at the platform and there was Ibrahim (as), safe and sound, but the ropes that he (as) was bound by had been burnt to ashes. So they informed Nimrod (la) of his (as) news. So he (la) ordered them to exile Ibrahim (as) from his (as) city, and prevent him (as) from the taking his (as) assets and his (as) wealth with him (as). So Ibrahim (as) disputed with them with regards to that. He (as) said: ‘If you (as) are confiscating my (as) assets and my (as) wealth, therefore it is my (as) right against you that you should return to me (as) what has gone from my (as) lifetime in your city’, and he (as) argued against the judge of Nimrod (la), so he judged that Ibrahim (as) should submit to him (la) all of what he (as) had acquired in their city, and that Nimrod (la) to return what had gone from his (as) life. The news of that reached Nimrod (la), so he (la) ordered that they should open the way for him (as) and allow him (as) to take his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and throw him (as) out from their city to Syria. So Ibrahim (as) went out, and with him (as) was Lut (as) who would not separate from him (as), and Sara, and said to them: ‘I (as) am going to my (as) Lord (azwj) to be Guided by Him (azwj)’ – meaning Bayt Al-Maqdis. So Ibrahim (as) took his (as) assets, and his (as) wealth, and constructed a carriage (Taboot), and made Sara to be in it, and locked it with locks, due to his (as) honour from it, and went until he (as) exited from the authority of Nimrod (la) and went to the authority of a man from the Coptics called Araarat. So they passed by a tax collector of his. The tax collector stopped him (as) in order to tax him (as) for what was with him (as). So when he (as) ended up with the tax collector and with him (as) was the carriage (Taboot), the tax collector said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Open this carriage (Taboot) until whatever is in it gets displayed’. So Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Say whatever you like with regards to it, from the gold or the silver and I (as) shall pay it as tax, but do not open it’. The tax collector refused until he opened it, and Ibrahim (as) was angry over its opening. So when Sara came out, and she had good qualities and was very beautiful, the tax collector said to him (as), ‘What is (the relationship of) this woman to you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said; ‘She is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and the daughter of my (as) aunt’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘So what made you (as) to place her in this carriage (Taboot)?’ Ibrahim (as) said: ‘The honour (Ghairat) against anyone looking at her’. So the tax collector said to him (as), ‘I will not leave you (as) to depart until I let the king know of her condition and yours (as)’. So he sent a messenger to the king, who let him know, and the king sent a messenger from him telling them to bring him (as) to him. So Ibrahim (as) said to them: ‘I (as) will not separate from the carriage (Taboot) even if my (as) soul separates from my (as) body’. So they informed the king about that, and the king sent a message that they should bring him (as) and the box with him (as). So they took Ibrahim (as), and the carriage (Taboot), and all what was with him (as) until they came up to the king. The king said to him (as), ‘Open the carriage (Taboot)!’ So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘O king! In it is my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife), the daughter of my (as) aunt, and I (as) am prepared to ransom all what is with me (as)’. The king got angry and forced Ibrahim (as) to open it. So when he saw Sara, he could not control his foolishness, and extended his hand towards her. Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from her and from him due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife) and daughter of my (as) aunt!’ So his hand could not arrive to her nor would it return back to him. So the king said to him (as), ‘Was it your (as) Lord (azwj) Who did this to me?’ He (as) said to him: ‘Yes. Surely, my (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour). He (azwj) Abhors the Prohibited, and He (azwj) is the One Who Made this situation between you and what you intended from the Prohibited’. The king said to him (as), ‘So supplicate to your (as) God that He (azwj) should Return my hand back to me. If He (azwj) Answers you (as), I will never present (myself) to her’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘My (as) God! Return his hand back to him, so that he would refrain from my (as) sanctity (Hurmat i.e. wife)’. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Returned his hand back to him. The king came near to her and looked at her, then extended his hand around her. So Ibrahim (as) turned his (as) face away from it due to his (as) honour (Ghairat) from it, and said; ‘Our Allah (azwj)! Withhold his hand from her! So his hand withered and could not arrive to her. So the king said to Ibrahim (as), ‘Surely your (as) Lord (azwj) is Honourable (Ghayyour) and so are you, so supplicate to your God that He (azwj) should return my hand back to me, for it is an action that I shall not repeat. Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘I (as) will ask Him (azwj) upon the condition that you will not ask me (as) again to supplicate to Him (azwj)’. The king said, ‘Yes’. So Ibrahim (as) said: ‘Our Allah (azwj)! If he is truthful, Return his hand! His hand returned back to him. So when the king saw that from the honour which he had never seen before, and saw the Sign in (the return of) his hand, he magnified Ibrahim (as), and endowed him (as) (with gifts), and honoured him (as), and let him (as) leave and said to him (as), ‘I grant you (as) safety from displaying her, or for anything else which is with you (as). So go to wherever you like, but I have a need from you (as)’. Ibrahim (as) said: ‘What is it?’ He said to him (as), ‘I would love it if you (as) would permit me that I should give her an attendant who is a Coptic woman who has beauty and intellect, who will serve her’. So Ibrahim (as) gave him permission for that. So he called for her, and gifted her to Sara, and she is Hajar, mother of Ismail (as). Ibrahim (as) travelled with all of what was with him (as), and the king came out with him, walking behind Ibrahim (as), in respect of Ibrahim (as) and for his (as) prestige. So Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Revealed to Ibrahim (as): “Pause, and do not walk in front of the domineering tyrant and he walks behind you (as), but make him to be in front of you (as) and walk, and show him respect, and prestige, for he is domineering, and it is necessary for there to be authorities in the earth, be they righteous or immoral”. So Ibrahim (as) paused and said to the king: ‘Wait, for my (as) God has revealed unto me (as) at this very moment that I (as) should show you respect, and honour you, and make you to walk in front of me (as), and I (as) should walk behind you, due to your majesty’. So the king said to him (as), ‘This has been Revealed unto you (as)?’ Ibrahim (as) said to him: ‘Yes’. So the king said to him (as), ‘I testify that surely your (as) God is Friendly, Lenient, generous, and that you are making me incline towards your (as) Religion’. And the king bade farewell to them. So Ibrahim (as) journeyed until he (as) encamped at the high place of Syria, and left behind Lut (as) in the lower valleys of Syria. Then, when the birth of a son was delayed, Ibrahim (as) said to Sara: ‘If you want, you can sell Hajar to me (as), perhaps Allah (azwj) would Grant us the sustenance of a son from it, who would become a successor for us’. So Ibrahim (as) bought Hajar from Sara. He (as) went to her, and she gave birth to Ismail (as)’.",

I (saww) asked my (saww) Lord (azwj) to Establish friendship between me (asws) and you (asws), so He (azwj) Did it.

Ali Bin Muhammad, from Ali Bin Al-Abbas, from Ali Bin Hammad, from Amro Bin Shimr, from Jabir, who has narrated the following: ‘Abu Ja’far (asws) regarding the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[42:23] and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein”, said; ‘The one who befriends (Tawalla) the successors (asws) from the Progeny (asws) of Muhammad (saww), and follows their (asws) footsteps, so that increases for him the Wilayah of the ones from the past from the Prophets (as), and the former Believers until their Wilayah arrives to Adam (as), and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) “[27:89] Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it”, He (azwj) will Enter him into the Paradise, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj): “[34:47] Say: Whatever reward I have asked of you, that is only for yourselves”. He (saww) is saying that the reward is the cordiality which I (saww) never asked for anything other than it, so it is for you to be guided by it, and to be Rescued by it from the Punishment on the Day of Judgement’. And he (saww) said to the enemies of Allah (azwj), the friends of Satan (la), the people of the belying and the denial: “[38:86] Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this, nor am I a pretender”. He (saww) is saying; ‘I (saww) would be a pretender if I (saww) were to ask you what you are not deserving of’. So the hypocrites said to each other, with regards to that, ‘But it did not suffice Muhammad (saww) after having conquered us for twenty years, to the extent that he (saww) now wants to burden us with the People (asws) of his (saww) Household upon our necks’. So they said, ‘Allah (azwj) has not Revealed this, nor is it anything except for his (saww) words, intending to raise the People (asws) of his (saww) Household upon our necks, and if Muhammad (saww) were to be killed or dies, we would take it (rule) away from the People (asws) of his (saww) Household, then we would not let it return to be among them ever’. And Allah (azwj) Wanted to let know His (azwj) Prophet (saww) of that which was hidden in their chests and what they were keeping as a secret. So He (azwj) Said in His (azwj) Book: “[42:24] Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart”. He (azwj) is Saying: “Had I (azwj) so Liked to, I (azwj) would have Stopped the Revelation, so you (saww) would not have been able to speak of the virtues of the People (asws) of your (saww) Household, or of their cordiality”. And Allah (azwj) has Said: “[42:24] And Allah will wipe out the lie and will vindicate the truth by His words” He (azwj) is Saying that the truth is the Wilayah for the People (asws) of the Household “Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts”, and is Speaking of what is attached in their chests from the enmity to the People (asws) of the Household, and the injustices after you (saww), and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[21:3] and those who are unjust counsel together in secret: He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves; what! will you then yield to enchantment while you see?” And regarding the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[53:1] I swear by the star when it goes down He (asws) said; ‘(It means) I (azwj) Swear by the passing away of Muhammad (saww) when he (saww) passes away [53:2] Your companion does not err, in giving out the virtues of the People (asws) of his (saww) Household nor does he go astray; [53:3] Nor does he speak out of desire. He (azwj) is Saying that he (saww) does not speak of the virtues of the People (asws) of his (saww) Household out of his (saww) own desires, and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic [53:4] It is naught but revelation that is revealed”. And Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said to Muhammad (saww): “[6:58] Say: If that which you desire to hasten were with me, the matter would have certainly been decided between you and me”. He (saww) said: ‘Had I (saww) been Commanded to, I (saww) would have informed you all of what you are hiding in your chests of the hastening of my (saww) passing away, so that you would perpetrate injustices to the People (asws) of my (saww) Household from after me (saww). So the example of yours in as Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[2:17] Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when it had illumined all around him”, He (azwj) is Saying; “Illumination of the earth by the light of Muhammad (saww) just like the illumination of the sun”. So Allah (azwj) Cited an example of Muhammad (saww) with the sun, and an example of the successor (asws) with the moon, and it is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[10:5] He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness and the moon a light”, and His (azwj) Statement: “[36:37] And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are in the dark”, and the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[2:17] Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when it had illumined all around him, Allah took away their light, and left them in utter darkness - they do not see”, meaning, the passing away of Muhammad (saww) and the appearance of the darkness, so they cannot see the virtues of the People (asws) of his (saww) Household, and it is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[7:198] And if you invite them to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them looking towards you, yet they do not see”. Then the Rasool Allah (saww) placed the knowledge which was with him (saww) to be with the successor (asws), and it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[24:35] Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth, He (azwj) is Saying: “I (azwj) am the Guide of the Heavens and the earth, like the Knowledge which I (azwj) Gave out, and it is My (azwj) Light with which I (azwj) Guide by a likeness of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, so the niche is the heart of Muhammad (saww), and the lamp is the Light in which is the Knowledge. And His (azwj) Statement the lamp is in a glass, He (azwj) is Saying: “I (azwj) Wanted to Make you (saww) pass away, and Make that which is in your presence to be with the successor (asws) just as the lamp is made to be in a glass, (and) the glass is as it were a brightly shining star, lit from a blessed tree”. So the origin of the Blessed Tree is Ibrahim (as) and it is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[11:73] The mercy of Allah and His blessings are on you, O people of the house, surely He is Praised, Glorious”. And it is the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[3:33] Surely Allah chose Adam and Nuh and the descendants of Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above the nations [3:34] Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing”. “[24:35] neither eastern nor western”. He (azwj) is saying: “You are neither Jews so that you Pray in the direction of the west, nor are you Christians, so that you Pray in the direction of the east, but you are the nation of Ibrahim (as)”, and Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Said: “[3:67] Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was (an) upright (man), a Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists”. And it is the Statement of the Mighty and Majestic: “[24:35] the oil whereof almost gives light though fire touch it not - light upon light - Allah guides to His light whom He pleases”, He (azwj) is Saying: “The example of your children whom you give birth to from among you, is like the example of the oil which comes out from the olive, “[24:35] the oil whereof almost gives light though fire touch it not - light upon light - Allah guides to His light whom He pleases”. He (azwj) is saying that they almost speak with the Prophet-hood even though an Angel has not descended upon them’.",

He said, ‘Inform be about your sin until I understand it, and I can repent if I were to commit it in order to derive strength for the Prayers’. He said, ‘Enter the city and ask around for so and so female prostitute. Give her two Dirhams, and benefit from her’. He said, ‘I do not know where I would get two Dirhams from?’ So the Devil took two Dirhams from under his feet and gave these to him. So he stood up and entered the city wearing his robe, asking around for the house of that prostitute. The people guided him thinking that he is going there to advise her, so they guided him. So he went to her and threw the two Dirhams at her and said, ‘Stand up’. So she stood up and entered inside her house, and she said, ‘Enter, and you have come to me in a dress which no one has come to me wearing the like of it. So, inform me of your news’. So he informed her. She said to him, ‘O servant of Allah (azwj)! The avoidance of sin is easier than repenting for it, and every repentant person does not find it (Accepted). But rather, it is befitting that he is a Devil who looks like you. So leave, for you will not see anything’. So he left, and she died that very night, and there was found written on her door, ‘Be cautious of this one, for she is from the inhabitants of the Paradise!’ The people became suspicious, so they waited for three days and did not bury her due to their doubts in her matter. So Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Revealed unto a Prophet (as) from the Prophets (as) unknown to anyone except for Musa Bin Imran (as) that: “Go to her and Pray over her and order the people to Prayed over her, for I (azwj) have Forgiven her, and Obligated the Paradise for her, for her discouraging My (azwj) servant from disobeying Me (azwj)’.",

Ahmad Bin Muhammad Bin Ahmad, from Ali Bin Al-Hassan, from Muhammad Bin Abdullah Bin Zurara, from Muhammad Bin Al-Fazeyl, from Abu Hamza, who has narrated the following: Abu Ja’far (asws) has said: ‘There used to be a man in the Children of Israel, who was a worshipper who was a derived person. Whenever he turned his attention to anything, he would achieve nothing from it. So his wife used to spend on him until there was nothing left. So there came a day from the days when she handed over to him a spinning blade and said to him, ‘There is nothing else in my possession apart from it, so go and sell it, and buy for us something to eat’. So he went with the spinning blade for selling it. He found the market to be closed, but found two prospective buyers. He stood by them, but they were not interested and left. So he said (to himself), ‘If I could come to this water, I could perform ablution from it and bathe in it’, and he left. He came up to the sea shore and there was a fisherman there who had cast his net. When he pulled it out, there was nothing in it except for one fish which had turned soft and rotten. So he said to him, ‘Sell me this fish and I will give you this blade which you can benefit by with your fishing net. He said, ‘Yes’. So he took the fish and handed over the blade to him, and left with the fish to his house. He informed his wife of the news, so she took the fish in order to prepare it. When she sliced it open, a pearl came out from the middle of it. So his wife called him and showed it to him. He took it with him and went to the market. He sold it for twenty thousand Dirhams, and left for his house with the wealth. He placed it therein. Then a beggar came and knocked on the door and said, ‘O people of the house, give charity to a poor one, Allah (azwj) will have Mercy upon you’. The man said, ‘Enter’. So he entered. He said, ‘Take one of the two bags’. So he took one of them and left. So his wife said to him, ‘Glory be to Allah (azwj)! As soon as we have ease, half of it goes away from us’. No sooner had she said that, the beggar knocked on the door. The man said to him, ‘Enter’. So he came and placed the bag back in its place, then said, ‘Congratulations! Eat it rightfully. But rather, I am an Angel from the Angels of your Lord (azwj). Your Lord (azwj) Wanted to Try you, so He (azwj) found you to be appreciative’. Then he left’.",

        "englishText": "585. Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from Sa’d Bin Al-Munzar Bin Muhammad, from his father, from his grandfather, from Muhammad Bin Al-Husayn, from his grandfather, from his father who said: ‘Amir-ul-Momineen (asws) gave a sermon’. (And someone else has also reported it without the above chain and mentioned that he (asws) gave the sermon as Zeeqaar). So he (asws) Praised Allah (azwj) and Extolled Him (azwj), then said: ‘Having said that, Allah (azwj) Blessed and High Sent Muhammad (saww) to take His (azwj) servants out from worshipping His (azwj) servants to worship Him (azwj), and from the covenants of His (azwj) servants to His (azwj) Covenant, and from obedience to His (azwj) servants to be in obedience to Him (azwj), and from the Wilayah of His (azwj) servants to His (azwj) Wilayah by good news and warnings. And he (saww) called to Allah (azwj) by His (azwj) Permission, and was an illuminating lamp, promising, and beginning, and excusing, and warning by the Judgements that he (saww) had decided, and decided what he (saww) had judged, and a Criterion which differentiated, and a Quran which Proved Him (azwj), so the servants would come to know their Lord (azwj) which they were ignorant of, and accept by it which they struggled against, and Establish Him (azwj) after having denied Him (azwj). So He (azwj) illustrated to them His (azwj) Glory in His (azwj) Book without them having seen Him (azwj). So he (azwj) Showed them His (azwj) Forbearance, how He (azwj) Forbears, and Showed them His (azwj) Forgiveness how He (azwj) Forgives, and Showed them His (azwj) Power and how Powerful He (azwj) is, and Frightened them from His (azwj) Authority, and how He (azwj) Created what He (azwj) Created from the Signs, and how He (azwj) Destroys the one whom He (azwj) Destroys from the disobeyers by the examples. And how he (azwj) Repelled the one whom He (azwj) repelled by the Torments, and how he (azwj) Sustained and Guided, and Granted, and Showed them His (azwj) Wisdom how Wise He (azwj) is, and Patient until they heard what they heard and saw. So Allah (azwj) Sent Muhammad (saww) with that. Then there will come upon you, from after me (asws) an era, and there will be nothing in that era which will be more hidden than the truth, nor anything more apparent than the falsehood, and nothing more numerous than the lies against Allah (azwj) the High and His (azwj) Messenger (saww). And there will be nothing in that era which will be more worthless than the Book when it is recited as it deserves to be recited, nor anything more worthy of selling and expensive in price than the Book if it is altered from its places. And there will be nothing in the servants nor in the cities anything which is more prevented than the good nor anything more recognised than the evil. And there will be nothing considered to be more immoral and evil, and no worse penalty than for the guidance in the presence of misguidance. During that era, those who bear the Book will be rejected and the memorizers will forget to the extent that they will interpret it in accordance with their own desires, and they would have inherited that from their forefathers, and they will act with alterations in the Book, lying and rejecting. So they will sell it for a cheap price, and they would be from the ascetics. So the Book and the People of the Book during that era would be two castaway fugitives, and two accompanying companions in one road not finding any protector or shelter. They are both good for each other and Whom (azwj) they work for. So the Book and the People of the Book during that era would be in the people but not be among (part of) them, and will be with them but still not be with them, and that is because the misguidance is not in harmony with the guidance. And if they meet, and the people would have met upon the sectarianism, and would separate from the group. They would give the rule of the matters of their Religion to the one who acts with regards to them by plotting, and the evil, and the bribery, and the murder, as if they are the imams (leaders) of the Book then the Book is not their imam (leading them). There will not remain in their possession from the truth except for its name, and they will not recognise anything from the Book except for its calligraphy and design. The entering one will enter (the religion) when he hears for the Judgements of the Quran, but he will not be satisfied in gatherings until he exits from the Religion. He will transfer from a Religion of a king to a Religion of a king, and from the wilayah of a king to a wilayah of a king, and from obedience of a king to the obedience of a king, and from the covenant of a king to a covenant of a king. So Allah (azwj) Lures them away from where they do not know, with good expectations and the hope until they give birth in the disobedience, and they make a religion with the tyranny, and the Book did not benefit them anything, and they will be wandering and straying, for they would have made a religion without the Religion of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic, and for the sake of other than Allah (azwj). Their Masjid during that era would be constructed from misguidance, ruination of guidance. So its reciters and its builders would be the most failed ones among the creatures of Allah (azwj) and His (azwj) creatures. It is from their presence that misguidance would flow and return back to them. Thus, presence in their Masjids, and walking towards them would be blasphemy (Kufr) with Allah (azwj) the Magnificent, except for the one who walks towards it while being aware of their misguidance. Therefore, due to their actions upon that way, their Masjids would have become ruination of the guidance, and well-built in the misguidance, for the Sunnah of Allah (azwj) would have been changed, and His (azwj) Limits transgressed against. They will not be calling to the guidance, nor distribution the booty (Al-Fey), nor fulfilling the responsibilities. They will be calling the one from among them who would be killed upon that as a martyr, thus forging a lie against Allah (azwj), and the struggle, and they would be needless from the knowledge due to their ignorance, and from before they mutilated the righteous ones with every mutilation, and named their truthfulness to Allah (azwj) as libel, and apply the punishment for the sins to the good deeds. And Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Sent to you all a Messenger (saww) from yourselves. It grieves him (saww) to see you suffering, and he (saww) is kind and merciful to the Believers. And He (azwj) Revealed upon him (saww) a Mighty Book. “[41:42] Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it; a revelation from the Wise, the Praised One” “[39:28] An Arabic Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil)” “[36:70] That it may warn him who would have life, and (that) the word may prove true against the unbelievers”. So do not let your hopes to distract you, nor consider the term (of life) to be prolonged, for the ones before you were destroyed for having long hopes against their approaching deadline until the Promised time (of death) descended upon them, and repulsed from them the excuses, and raised from them the repentance, and brought with it the calamity and the resentment. And Allah (azwj) has Preached to you with the Promise, and Made Decisive for you the speech, and Taught you the Sunnah, and Explained for you the Program to remove the illness, and Urged upon the Remembrance, and Evidence to the Salvation. And the one who act for the sake of Allah (azwj) and take His (azwj) Words as Evidence, would be Guided until he is strong, and Made to understand the right way, and Guided and facilitated to the good. So the one under the Protection of Allah (azwj) is safely preserved, and His (azwj) enemies would be in fearful and pretentious. So be cautious of Allah (azwj) through the frequency of the Remembrance, and be fearful from Him (azwj) by the piety, and get closer to Him (azwj) by the obedience, for He (azwj) is Close by and Answers. Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[2:186] And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way”. So you must respond to Allah (azwj) and believe in Him (azwj), and Magnify Allah (azwj). It does not befit one who recognises the Greatness of Allah (azwj) to consider himself as significant. So the highest of the recognition of the Greatness of Allah (azwj) is being modest to Him (azwj), and the highest honour of the one who knows the Majesty of Allah (azwj) is to be humble to Him (azwj), and the most secure is the one who knows the Power of Allah (azwj) and submits to Him (azwj). So you will not be denying yourselves after the Guidance of the understanding, nor will you be going astray after the Guidance. So do not flee from the truth like the fleeing of the healthy ones from the one with the scabies, and the healthy ones from the sick. And know that you will never recognise the guidance until you recognise the ones who have left it, and will never take to the Covenant of the Book until you recognise the ones who broke it, and will never attach yourselves to it until you recognise the ones who have abandoned it, and will never be able to recite the Book as it deserves to be recited until you recognise the ones who altered it, and will never recognise the misguidance until you recognise the Guidance, and will never recognise the piety until you recognise the ones who abused it. So when you recognise that, you will recognise the innovations, and the impersonations, and you will see the fabrications against Allah (azwj) and against His (azwj) Messenger (saww), and the alterations to His (azwj) book, and you will see how Allah (azwj) Guided the one whom He (azwj) Guided. So do not let those who have no knowledge keep you ignorant. The Knowledge of the Quran cannot be known as to what it is except by the one (asws) who has tasted its food. So it was by the knowledge that his ignorance got to know, and his blindness got to visualise, and his deafness got to hear, and gained awareness of what knowledge had passed by and got revived by it after its death. And he established the good deeds in the Presence of Allah (azwj) and deleted the sins by it. And it was by it (knowledge) that he realised the Pleasure from Allah (azwj) Blessed and High. So, seek that from its special people, for they (asws) are the specialists, lights to be illuminated by, and the Imams (asws) to be followed. And they (asws) are the life for the knowledge and death for the ignorance. They (asws) are the ones (asws) whose Judgements inform you of their (asws) knowledge, and their (asws) silence about their (asws) speech, and their (asws) apparent about their (asws) hidden. They (asws) do not oppose the religion nor do they (asws) differ with regards to it. For it (knowledge) is a truthful witness between them (asws), and a silent speaker. It is from their (asws) glories to testify to the truth, and to be truthful reporters, neither opposing the truth nor differing with regards to it. The Precedence is for them (asws) from Allah (azwj), and Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic has Passed a Truthful Judgement for them (asws). And in that is a reminder for the speakers. So bear in mind the truth if you hear it with a caring mind and not with a narrative mind, for the narrators of the Book are many, and its guardians are few. And Allah (azwj) is the Best Supporter’.",

Muhammad, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from Ibn Mahboub, from Jameel Bin Salih, from Sadeyr who said: ‘A man asked Abu Ja’far (asws) about the Statement of Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic: “[34:19] And they said: O our Lord! make spaces to be longer between our journeys; and they were unjust to themselves”. He (asws) said: ‘They were a people who live in two inter-connected villages and were able to see each other, and rivers which flowed, and phenomenal wealth. They denied the Favours of Allah (azwj) and changed what was in themselves, so Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Sent the flood of Al-Aram against them. Their two villages were submerged, and their houses were spoilt, and their wealth was gone. It changed their plantations into two plantations to be only with the edible plants of bitter tamarisk (a troublesome weed) and a few Lutus trees. Then Allah (azwj) Mighty and Majestic Said: “[34:17] This We requited them with because they disbelieved; and We do not punish any but the ungrateful”.",

He (asws) said: ‘That is what we (asws) are, and the Praise is due to Allah (azwj) that we (asws) do not enter anyone into misguidance, nor do we (asws) take anyone out of Guidance.
