Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Rib’i ibn ‘Abd Allah from a man from Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) who has said the following: “Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, created the prophets from the clay of ‘Illiyiyyn (paradise), both their bodies and souls. He made the hearts of the believers from such clay and He made their bodies from a world lower than that world. He created the unbelievers, both their bodies and souls from the clay of Sijjin (fire). He thus mixed the two clays. For this reason children of unbelievers become believers and vice versa. For this reason the believers get afflicted with evil and unbelievers receive good things. Thus, the hearts of the believers incline to that from which they are created and the hearts of the unbelievers incline to that from which they are created.” ",

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Hassan from al- Nadr ibn Shu’ayb from ‘Abd al-Ghaffar al-Jaziyy from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, created the believers from the clay of paradise. He created the unbelievers from the clay of fire. He then said, ‘When Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, decides to grant good to one of His servants. He purifies his spirit and body. Whenever he hears any good thing he recognizes it. Whenever he hears any bad things he dislikes them.’ I (the narrator) then heard him saying, ‘The clays are of three kinds: (a) one is the clay of the prophets from which the believers are also created, except that the prophets are made of the superior kind of clay. The prophets are the roots and the believers are the branches and for this reason they are more excellent than the believers. The believers are created from a stickier kind of clay. Thus Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious will not keep them apart from their followers.’ The Imam than said, ‘The clay of those who insult (‘ A’immah ) are from a black clay that smells foul. The weak ones are made from soil. The believers do not change their faith nor do evil doers (those who insult ‘ A’immah , recipients of divine supreme covenant) do so and Allah has a definite goal behind it.’” ",

He made the hearts of our followers from that which He had created us.

All of the above have narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Uwarma from Muhammad ibn Ali from ‘Isma’il ibn Yasar from ‘Uthman ibn Yusuf who has said that, reported to him ‘Abd Allah ibn Kaysan, from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “Once I said to the Imam, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, I am your servant, abu ‘Abd Allah ibn Kaysan.’ The Imam said, ‘I know your genealogy. However, I do not know you (so well).’ I said, ‘I was born in the mountains and grew up in the land of Persia. I associate with people in business and other occasions. I, thus, associate with a man and find his appearance very good, to be of good manners and more trustworthy. When I investigate 1 find him to be one of your enemies. I also associate with another man who has bad manners, is less trustworthy and hot tempered. I then investigate and find him to be of your supporters and followers. Why is it so?’ “He (the Imam) said, ‘O ibn Kaysan, Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, took a clay from paradise and also from fire and then mixed them together. Then He separated this from that and that from this. The good appearances, good manners and trustworthiness that you find in them (our enemies) is because of the touch of the clay from paradise but they will return to that from which they are made. The deceitfulness, bad manners and hot-temperament that you find in them (our supporters and followers) is because of the touch of the clay from fire, however, they will return to that from which they were made.’” ",

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Salih ibn abu Hammad from al-Husayn ibn Yazid from al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn abu Hamza from Ibrahim from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “When Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, willed to create Adam He sent Jibril in the first hours of the Friday. He picked up with his right hand a handful. His hand had in its reach from the seventh heavens to the heaven above earth. From each of the heavens he picked up a handful. He also picked up another handful from the seventh earth of the above-most and to the farthest seventh earth. Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, then commanded His word to hold the first handful in his right and the other in his left. The clay then was cleaved into two. It was scattered from earth and from the heavens and then said to the clay in his right hand, ‘From you will be the messengers, the prophets, their successors, the truthful ones, the believers, those who will achieve salvation and those whom I will to have honors.’ It then became necessary for them to be as He said them to be. He then said to that which was on his left, ‘From you will be the tyrants, the polytheists, the unbelievers, the devils and those whom I will to humiliate and be of the wicked ones.’ It then became necessary for them to become what He said them to become. Thereafter the two clays mixed together as Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, has said, ‘Allah makes the seed and the nuts to cleave apart.’ (6:95) The seed is the clay of the believers upon which Allah has placed His love. The nuts are the clay of the unbelievers that are far from all good. It is called nuts (al- Nawa’) because it is far away from all good and from Him. Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, has said, ‘He (Allah) brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living.’ (6:95) The living are the believers who come out from the unbelievers and the dead who come out of the living are the unbelievers who are from the believers. The living are the believers and the dead are the unbelievers. This is because of the words of Allah, ‘Are those whom We brought to life after their being dead . . .’ (6:122) Their death was the mixing of their clay with the clay of the unbelievers and his coming to life was when Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, caused separation between them through His word. In this way Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, takes the believers at birth out to light from darkness after their entering therein and He takes the unbelievers out of the light to darkness after their entering into the light as it is said in the words of Allah, the Majestic the Glorious, ‘So that he can give warning to those who are of the living and the word about the unbelievers truly come to pass.’” (36:70) ",

He asked them, “Am 1 not your Lord and is not this Muhammad, My messenger and is not this Ali, the commander of the believers?” They said, “Yes, it is just as You said.” This established their prophethood. He then made the ‘Ulu al-’Azm messengers to testify and acknowledge this fact: “I am your Lord, Muhammad is My messenger, Ali is the commander of the believers and his successors, recipients of divine supreme covenant, after him are people who possess My Authority and are the reservoir of My knowledge. That al-Mahdi (a.s.) is one whom I will make to lend support to My religion. Through him I will establish My kingdom on earth and make My enemies to face justice for their crimes. Through him I will make them to worship Me willingly or otherwise.” The prophets altogether said, “Yes, Lord we testify to these facts and bear witness.” Adam did not refuse and did not affirm (verbally) the fact about al-Mahdi (a.s.) so he was not included in the group of five ‘Ulu al-’Azm messengers of Allah. Adam did not have the resolve to affirm the facts about al-Mahdi, recipient of divine supreme covenant. Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, has said in the Holy Quran, “We had made a covenant with Adam before but he forgot all about it and we did not find in him a firm resolve.” (20:115) He said that it was so but he ignored it.

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad and Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from al-Hassan ibn Mahbub from Hisham ibn Salim from Habib al-Sajistani who has said the following: “I heard abu Ja’far (a.s.) saying, ‘There was a time when Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, took the descendents of Adam from his back to establish a covenant with them to testify that He is their Lord and to believe in the prophethood of all the prophets. The first among the prophets whose prophethood Allah wanted them to accept through a covenant was Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah, recipient of divine supreme covenant. Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, then said to Adam, “Look (to find) what you can see.” ‘The Imam then said, “Adam then looked and saw his descendents appearing as small particles that filled the sky. Adam then said, ‘Lord, how huge in number my descendents are! For what purpose have You created them and for what reason did You make them to establish a covenant with You?’” Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, replied, “So that they worship Me and do not consider anything else as My equal and so that they believe in My messengers and follow them (for guidance).” Adam then asked, “Lord, why is it that I see certain ones of the particles are greater, others have a great deal of lights, yet others among them have very little light and still others among them have no lights at all?” Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, replied, “Thus, I have created them to place them to test in every condition that they will live.” Adam then asked, “My Lord, will You grant me permission to speak so I may express myself?” Allah, the Majestic the Glorious said, “Speak up; your spirit is from My spirit but your nature is different from My being.” Adam then asked, “Lord, had You created them all just like each other, by the same measure, the same nature, of likewise design, of the same color, of equal life span, of equal amount of means of living they would not act against each other. No jealousy, animosity and differences would exist among them over anything.” Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, said, “O Adam, through My spirit you just spoke and due to the weakness of your nature you made an effort to give an opinion about that of which you have no knowledge. I Am the Creator of the world. I knowingly have created each one different from the others and through My Own way I will make My commands to take effect and they will continue existing through My plans and measures. There will be no changes in My creation. I have created the Jinn and human beings only to worship Me. I have created paradise for those who obey and worship Me and follow My messengers. I have no regrets in what 1 have done. I have created the fire for those who disbelieve, disobey Me and do not follow My messengers and I have no regrets in it. I have created you and your descendents not because I ever need you or your descendents in anyway or form. I have created you and created them to test you and test them to see which ones among you do good deeds in the worldly life before your deaths. For this reason I have created the world and the life thereafter, life, death, obedience, disobedience, paradise and the fire. This is how I willed in My measure and plan. Through My all-pervasive knowledge in them I have placed differences in their forms, bodies, colors, lifespan, means of living, obedience and disobedience. I, thus, have made certain ones of them to be unfortunate or very fortunate. Certain ones among them will have eyesight or be blind, others among them will be of short size or tall ones, beautiful or otherwise, knowledgeable or ignorant, wealthy or poor, obedient or disobedient, of good health or suffering from illness, of defective bodies or free of bodily defects. In this way those of perfect bodies will look at the defective ones and thank Me for the perfect body that 1 have given them and those with defective bodies will look at the perfect ones and will pray to Me and ask Me to grant them good health and exercise patience when and in the way I test them. Thus, I will grant them good rewards. The wealthy ones after looking to the poor ones will thank Me and appreciate My favors. When the poor ones look to the wealthy ones they pray to Me and ask Me favors. It is as such so that the believers will look to the unbelievers and thank Me for the guidance that I have granted them. For such reasons I have created them. I test them in ease and in hardships and in good health that I grant them and in the matters with which I test them, in the matters of what I grant them and in the matters that 1 refuse them. I am Allah, the powerful King. It is all up to Me to allow all of My measures and plans to take form or change them as I wish to the time that I wish. I may change the sequel of the timing of my measures and plans and allow, that which comes first to come last and vice versa. I am Allah, and I execute whatever I will. I am not questioned for whatever I do but 1 question My creatures about their deeds.’”” ",

On the other hand 1 find certain persons of those who do not accept our belief seem to (have very good Simt) be very dignified.’ The Imam said, ‘Do not call it Simt because Simt means straight path. Call it Dignified appearance because Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, has said, “They have marks of the effects of frequent prostration on their faces,”’ (48:29). I (the narrator) then said, ‘I see them to be of good appearance and of dignity and this makes me very sad.’ The Imam said, ‘Do not feel sad for what you see of light-mindedness and temperamental conditions of your people and the good appearance of those who do not accept your belief. When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, willed to create Adam, He created those two kinds of clay. He then divided them into two portions. To the people of the right hand He said, “Be a creature by My permission.” They became creatures that looked like small particles running around. He then said to the people of the left hand, “Be a creature by My permission.” They became a creature as small particles that crawled. He then started a fire for them and said to them, “Enter therein by My permission.” The first one who entered therein was Muhammad (a.s.) followed by the ‘Ulu al-’Azm messengers, their successors and their followers. He then said to the people of the left hand, “Enter therein by My permission.” They said, “Our Lord, have you created us just to burn?” They disobeyed. He then said to the people of the right hand, “Come out from the fire by My permission” and the fire had caused no injuries to any of them and had left no marks on any one of them. When the people of the left hand saw this they said, “Our Lord, we see our people have come out safe and sound from the fire. Lord, forgive us and command us to enter the fire.” The Lord said, “I Have forgiven you, now you must enter the fire.” They went near the fire but when they felt the heat of the fire they turned back and said, “Our Lord, we are not able to endure the fire burning us and they disobeyed.” He commanded those ones three times to enter into the fire but every time they disobeyed and turned back. He commanded the others three times, each time they obeyed and came out of the fire. He then said to them, “Be a clay by My permission.” He then created Adam therefrom.’ The Imam then said, ‘Whoever is of those will never become of these (people of the right hand) and whoever is from these will never become of those ones (people of the left hand). When you find your people as light-minded ones and it causes sadness to you it is because of their mix with people of the left hand.

The laws consisted of belief in monotheism, purity of such belief, the negation of all associates of Allah and the culture, that it is free and clean of idolatry, that it is easy to follow and that it does not allow total abandonment of the worldly life or total indulgence in it. He has made lawful in such a system of laws all that is good and clean and has made unlawful all that is filthy. Through such system He has removed all hardships and obstacles that were imposed on them (people). He then made it necessary for them, in such system of laws, to perform prayers, pay the charity ( Zakat ), complete the Fasting, and perform Hajj. And that they must fulfill their duty in the matters of virtue and vices (ask others to perform their duties and not to commit sins). And that they must follow the rules of lawful and unlawful matters, the rules of inheritance, penalties and compensations for losses and the obligations and the duty of Jihad (defending the faith) in the way of Allah. He has made Wuzu an additional obligation. He has granted him (the Holy Prophet) (a.s.) distinction through the following revelations: the first Chapter of the Holy Quran and the last verses of Chapter Two of the Holy Quran as well as the detailed Chapters from Chapter 47 to the end of the Holy Quran. He made lawful for Prophet Muhammad (a.s.) the spoils of war and the land given to him without resistance. He supported him by giving him an awesome personality, made for him the earth to use in performing prostration before the Lord and to use it to clean himself. He was sent to all human beings, black and white, and to all Jinns. He granted him authority to receive taxes. He helped him to capture the pagans and then set them free on being ransomed. Then he imposed on him such duties that were not imposed on the prophets before. He sent down to him from heaven an unsheathed sword. He was told, ‘Fight for the cause of Allah and do not hold anyone responsible besides your ownself. ’” (4:84) ",

Allah has mentioned it next to prayer but He has mentioned prayer first. The Messenger of Allah has said, “Al-Zakat removes sins.’” I then asked, ‘Which one is important thereafter?’ The Imam said, ‘Hajj is important thereafter. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “It is a duty of the people to Allah to perform Hajj of the House if they are capable to do so. Whoever rejects it should know that Allah does not need anyone in the world.” (3:97) The messenger of Allah has said, “Performing Hajj that is accepted is more virtuous than twenty Rak’at optional prayer. Whoever walks around the House seven times and performs the two Rak’at prayers thereafter properly Allah will grant him cover.” He (The Messenger of Allah) did say on the ninth of the month of Dil Hajj and on the tenth of the month of Dil Hajj in Muzdalifa (a place in Makka), what he wanted to say.’ I then asked, ‘Which one is important thereafter?’ The Imam said, ‘It is fasting.’ “I then asked, ‘Why is fasting the last of all in importance?’ The Imam said, ‘The Messenger of Allah has said, “Fasting is a shield against the fire.’” The narrator has said that the Imam said, ‘The best of all things is that for which, if you miss, you do not find an alternative accept going back to achieve it. Prayer, al-Wilayah and Hajj are not of matters replaceable with their own kind. On the other hand if fasting is missed on a journey one has the choice to fast on other days as remedy, or compensate for the sin with expiation and no fasting is necessary as a remedy. In the cases of the other four issues there is no alternative for them.’ The narrator has said that the Imam then said, ‘The topmost, the peak of the issue, the key and the door to it and the pleasure of the Beneficent (Lord) is to obey the Imam properly after knowing him clearly. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, “Whoever obeys the Messenger he has obeyed Allah and whoever turns away from such obedience then you should know that We have not sent you to guard them.” (4:80) ‘Without recognizing the Divine Authority of the Imam, the deputy of Allah, no one has the right to receive any reward from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy. This is true even though in his lifetime he may stand up in worship the whole night, fast during the day, give all his belongings in charity and perform Hajj every year. So also it is if he does not acknowledge the Divine Authority of his Imam with which all of one’s deeds can take place with the guidance of the Imam. Wiothout al- Wilayah, one is not considered of the people of belief.’ Thereafter the Imam said, ‘Allah will admit, those of them who do good deeds into paradise through His extra mercy.’” ",

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Safwan ibn Yahya from ‘Isa ibn al-Sariyy abu al-Yasa’ who has said the following: “Once I said to abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) ‘Teach me, please, the basic principles of Islam that are necessary for everyone to know to his limits of understanding, and if he fails to learn them to the necessary levels his religion is destroyed and Allah does not accept his deeds. What is the limit of learning about the deeds with which someone’s religion can take proper shape and Allah may accept his deeds? What are the limits and degrees of the permissible level of ignorance and lack of knowledge of certain aspects of these principles?’ “The Imam said, ‘The matters necessary to learn are to testify that no one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, that Muhammad (a.s.) is the Messenger of Allah, that whatever he has brought from Allah is the truth and to affirm that paying Zakat (charity) is a right. (Of such necessary matters is) to affirm al-Wilayah (Divine Authority of ‘ A’immah ) that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has made obligatory upon the other people to obey and acknowledge the Divine Authority of certain members of the family of Prophet Muhammad, recipient of divine supreme covenant.’ I (the narrator) then asked the Imam, ‘Is al-Wilayah of an exclusive nature?’ The Imam said, ‘Yes, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “O believers, obey Allah, obey the Messenger and those among you who possess Divine Authority.” (4:59) The Merssenger of Allah has said, “Whoever dies without knowing who the Imam of his time is, he is considered as a person dying in the time of ignorance (as an unbeliever).” There was the Messenger of Allah and there was Ali (a.s.) but others said there was Mu’awiyah. Then there was al-Hassan (a.s.) and then there was al-Husayn, recipient of divine supreme covenant. Others said that there were Yazid ibn Mu’awiyah and Husayn ibn Ali. They were not equals and certainly they were not equals, meaning thereby Ali, al-Hassan and al-Husayn with Mu’awiyah and his son Yazid.’ He has said that the Imam remained calm for a while and then said, ‘Do you want me to tell you additional facts?’ Hakam ibn al-’A’War said, ‘Yes, may Allah keep my soul in service to your cause.’ The Imam said, ‘Then there was Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) then there was Muhammad ibn Ali, abu Ja’far. The Shi’a before abu Ja’far did not know the rules of Hajj, the lawful matters and the unlawful matters until there was abu Ja’far, recipient of divine supreme covenant. He opened it (system of religion) for them and explained to them the rules of their Hajj, the lawful and unlawful matters. People began to realize that they needed him very much while before they would ask other people for what they needed. This is how the facts are. The earth does not remain without an Imam and one who dies without knowing, who his Imam is, he is as though he was of the people of the dark ages of ignorance. The time when you need al-Wilayah most urgently is the time when your soul reaches here (pointing to his throat) and the world is cut off from you and then you say, ‘I have certainly been on the good side of the affairs, (a supporter of al-Wilayah).”’’ Abu Ali al-Ash’ari has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar from Safwan from ‘Isa ibn al-Sariyy abu al-Yasa’ from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) a similar Hadith.

A number of our people have narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad and Muhammad ibn Yahya from Ahmad ibn Muhammad all of them from ibn Mahbub from Ali ibn Ri’ab from Humran ibn A’yun who has said the following: “I heard from Abu Ja’far (a.s.) saying, ‘Belief is what settles down in the heart and takes it to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy. One’s deeds testify to (its existence), (deeds) that come in the form of obedience to Allah and submission to His command. Islam is what appears through one’s words or deeds and that is what a group of people of all the sects live by. Through Islam lives are protected, inheritance is settled thereby, marriages become lawful and they have the prayer, al-Zakat (charity), the fasting and al-Hajj in common. This takes them out of rejection of belief and they are ascribed to belief. Islam is not inclusive of belief while belief is inclusive of Islam, but words and deeds are common among them. Just as the case of Holy Ka’ba is in the Sacred Mosque but the Sacred Mosque is not in the Holy Ka’ba so is belief that is inclusive of Islam but Islam is not inclusive of belief. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “The Arabs have said, ‘We have established belief.’ Say, “You have not established belief but say, ‘We have accepted Islam.’ Belief has not yet entered your hearts.”” (49:14) Therefore, the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, are the most truthful ones.’ 1 then said, ‘Does a believer have any distinction over a Muslim in terms of excellence, rules and judicial matters and so forth?’ He said, ‘No, they both in this matter walk the same path. However, a believer has distinction over a Muslim in the form of deeds through which he seeks nearness to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy.’ I said, ‘Does Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, not say, “Whoever does a good deed for him the reward will be tenfold. . . .” (6:160) You just stated that they both accept the obligations of the prayer, al-Zakat (charity), the fasting and al-Hajj.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Has Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, not said, “. . . He will add to his reward many additions.” (2:245) Believers are the ones to whose good deeds Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, increases seventy times. Thus is the distinction of the believer. Allah increases to his (believer’s) good deeds, proportionate to the degree of the correctness of his belief, many additions. Allah does good to the believer as He wishes.’ I said, ‘Is it not that whoever enters in Islam has entered belief?’ He said, ‘No, but he is ascribed to belief and has come out of rejection, and I will give you an example that will help understand the distinction of belief over Islam. Consider, if you see a person in the Sacred Mosque, do you testify that you have seen him in the Holy Ka’ba?’ I said, ‘No, that is not permissible for me.’ He said, ‘If you see a person in the Holy Ka’ba will you testify that he has entered the Sacred Mosque?’ I said, ‘Yes, I will do so.’ He asked, ‘Why do you do so?’ I said, ‘He cannot reach the Holy Ka’aba without entering first the Sacred Mosque.’ He said, ‘You said the right thing and you did well.’ He then said, ‘Thus, are Islam and belief.’” ",

Rejection (of Islam) is a house. Sometimes a servant (of Allah) is a Muslim before he becomes a believer but he cannot become a believer before becoming a Muslim. Therefore, Islam is before belief and it shares belief. Whenever a servant (of Allah) commits one of the major sins or one of the minor sins that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has prohibited he is out of belief and belief falls off of him but the name ‘Muslim’ still applies to him. When he repents and asks forgiveness he returns to the house of belief. Nothing takes him out to rejection but rejection of what is lawful, such as saying to what is lawful, ‘It is unlawful’ or saying lawful to what is unlawful and living thereby (such attitude) as a religion. In such a case one is out of Islam and belief and is in rejection. It is like one’s entering the Sacred Mosque then the Holy Ka’ba wherein he invents an act of heresy. He then is taken out of the Holy Ka’ba and the Sacred precinct and is decapitated and that turns him to hell (for his act of defiant and treachery).”’ ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ‘Uthman ibn ‘Isa from Sama’a ibn Mihran who has said the following: “I asked the Imam about belief and Islam, inquiring, ‘Is there a difference between Islam and belief?’ The Imam said, ‘I can give an example.’ I said, ‘Please do so.’ He said, ‘The case of belief and Islam is like the Holy Ka’ba and the Sacred precinct. One may have entered the Sacred precinct but not the Holy Ka’ba. One cannot enter the Holy Ka’ba before entering the Sacred precinct. One may become a Muslim but he may not yet be a believer. However, one cannot become a believer before becoming a Muslim.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘Can one go out of belief to anything?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ I asked, ‘What then does one become?’ He said, ‘One may go out to Islam or rejection (disbelief).’ He then said, ‘If a man enters the Holy Ka’ba and his urine comes out he is taken out of the Holy Ka’ba but he will not be taken out of the Sacred precinct. He washes his cloth and purifies and then he is not stopped from entering the Holy Ka’ba. However, if a man enters the Holy Ka’ba and urinates therein out of animosity he is taken out of the Holy Ka’ba and the Sacred Mosque and is decapitated.’” ",

        "englishText": "1. Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from certain persons of his people from Adam ibn Ishaq from ‘Abd al-Razzaq from ibn Mihran from al-Husayn ibn Maymun from Muhammad ibn Salim from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “Abu Ja’far (a.s.) has said, ‘Certain people have spoken from this Holy Quran without knowledge. It is because Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said, “It is Allah Who has revealed the Book to you in which certain verses are clear statements (that accept no interpretation), and these are the fundamental ideas of the Book, while other verses may have several possibilities. Those whose hearts are perverse follow the unclear statements in pursuit of their own mischievous goals by interpreting them in a way that will suit their own purpose. No one knows its true interpretations except Allah, and those who have a firm grounding in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it. All its verses are from our Lord.’ No one can grasp this fact except the people of reason.” (3:7) ‘The suspended verses are of the unclear ones and the verses whose meaning can clearly be understood are of the suspending ones. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, sent Prophet Noah to his people who said to them, “Worship Allah, have fear of Him and obey me” (71:3). He then called them to Allah alone to worship Him only and not to take any partners for Him. Thereafter He sent the prophets until (their coming ended with) Muhammad, recipient of divine supreme covenant. He invited people to worship Allah only and not to take partners for Him. And He said, “He has plainly clarified the religion which is revealed to you and that which Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were commanded to follow (He has explained it) so that you may remain steadfast and united in your religion. What you call the pagans to is extremely grave for them. Allah attracts (to the religion) whomever He wants and guides to it whoever turns to Him with repentance.” (42:13) ‘He sent the prophets to their people with the testimony that stated, “No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah and that whatever every one (of the prophets) has brought is from Allah.” Those who sincerely accepted the faith and died with what they had accepted, Allah, through this will, admit them in paradise. Allah is not unjust to His servants, and Allah will not punish a servant unless he intensely sins such as committing murder or the sins for which Allah has made it clear that perpetrators thereof go to hell. When the believers of the people of each prophet followed them He gave them a system of laws and guidance. Al-Shari’a is a system, a path and tradition. Allah said to Prophet Muhammad, “(Muhammad), We have sent revelations to you just as were sent to Noah and the prophets who lived after him . . .” (4:163). Allah commanded every prophet to follow the path and the tradition. Of the traditions that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, commanded Moses to follow was al-Sabbath. Those who observed its greatness and did not violate it out of respect for Allah, Allah admitted them to paradise. Those who violated its sanctity and considered lawful what Allah had made unlawful and prohibited, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, sent them to hellfire for their making fishing lawful. They captured fish and ate them on Sabbath. Allah showed anger toward them even though they had not taken anyone as partners of the Beneficent or doubted the truth of what Moses had brought. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “You certainly knew about those among you who were transgressors on the Sabbath. We commanded them, ‘Become detested apes . . (2:65) Then Allah sent Jesus with the testimony that said, “No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah and all that he (Jesus) had brought was from Allah.’’ He made for them a system of law and a path. He abolished the Sabbath for which they, before, were commanded to pay respect and the ways and traditions that Moses had brought. Whoever did not follow Jesus, Allah sent them to fire, although all that the prophets had said was that no one must be considered as a partner of Allah. Then He sent Prophet Muhammad and for the ten years that he lived in Makka everyone who testified to the fact that “No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His messenger” Allah admitted him to paradise just because of his affirmation. It was belief and affirmation. Allah did not punish anyone of those who died following Muhammad in that matter except those who took partners for the Beneficent. Evidence of this is what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has revealed in Chapter 17 in Makka). “Your Lord has ordained that you must not worship anything other than Him and that you must be kind to your parents ... He is Well-aware and watches over His servants.” (17:30) ‘It (besides belief in Allah) is discipline, advice and education. It (law) is a light prohibition and there is no warning about it and there is no warning against violating what is prohibited. He has revealed prohibitions of certain matters without warning (for issues less serious than disbelief) saying: “Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will give sustenance to all of you. To kill them is certainly a great sin. (17:31) “Do not even approach adultery. It is indecent and an evil act. (17:32) “Do not kill a respectable soul without a just cause. If anyone is wrongfully killed, We have given the heirs of that person the right (to demand satisfaction or to forgive). He must not exceed the law in having vengeance; law shall also assist his victim. (17:33) “Do not get close to the property of the orphans (unless it is for a good reason) until they are mature and strong. Keep your promise; you will be questioned about it. (17:34) “While weighing, use proper measurements in the exchange of your property. This is fair and will be better in the end. (17:35) “Do not follow what you do not know; the ears, eyes, and hearts will all be held responsible for their deeds. (17:36) “Do not walk proudly on the earth; your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains (17:37). All such things are sins and detestable in the sight of your Lord. (17:38) “(Muhammad), these are words of wisdom, which your Lord has revealed to you. Do not consider anything equal to Allah lest you be thrown into hell, despised, and driven away from Allah’s mercy.” (17:39) ‘(About more serious issues) Allah has also said, “By the night when it covers the day. (92:1) I have warned you about the fierce blazing fire (14) in which no one will suffer forever (15) except the wicked ones who have rejected the (Truth) and have turned away from it.” (92:16) ‘This (the wicked) is a pagan and in Chapter 84 Allah has said, “But as for those whose Book of Records will be given behind their backs, (84:10) they will say, ‘Woe to us!’ (11). They will suffer the heat of hellfire (12). They lived among their people joyfully (13) and had thought that they would never be brought back to life again.” (84:14) ‘This (one rejecting the Day of Judgment) is a pagan and in Chapter 67 Allah has said, “Whenever a group is thrown into it (hell), its keepers will ask them, ‘Did no one come to warn you? (67:8) “They will say, ‘Yes, someone did come to warn us, but we rejected him saying, “Allah has revealed nothing. You are in great error.”’ (67:9) ‘These are pagans and in Chapter 56 Allah has said, “If he is of those who have rejected the Truth and have gone astray, (56:92) the dwelling (for him) will be (in) boiling water (93) and the heat of hellfire.” (94) ‘These also are pagans. In Chapter 69 Allah has said, “However, one who will receive the book of the records of his deeds in his left hand will say, ‘I wish that this record was never given to me (69:25) and that I never known what my records contained. (26) Would that death had taken me away for good. (27) My wealth has been of no benefit to me (28) ... he did not believe in Allah, the Great . . .’ (69:33) ‘This also is a pagan, and in Chapter 26 Allah has said, “. . . hell will be left open for the rebellious ones (26:91) who will be asked, ‘What did you worship (26:92) besides Allah? Will the idols help you? Can they help themselves? (26:93). The idol worshippers, the idols, the rebellious ones, (26:94) and the army of Satan will all be thrown headlong into hell.’” (26:95) The army of Satan and his descendents are of the devils (Shayatin) ‘Allah’s words, “Only the sinful ones made us go astray,” (26:99) refers to pagans whom they had followed in their pagan manners and they were of the people of Prophet Muhammad (a.s.) of whom no one was a Jew or a Christian. Evidence of this is the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, in Chapter 38 verse 12, “The people of Noah then rejected our messengers.” “The dwellers of the forest also rejected the Messengers.” (26:176) “The people of Lot rejected the Messengers.” (26:160) ‘Among them there is no one of the Jews who considered ‘Uzayr as the son of Allah or of the Christians who considered Jesus as the son of Allah. Allah will send (such) Jews and Christians to fire as well as those who had acted similarly. It comes from their own word, “Only the sinful ones made us go astray,” (26:99) they invited us to their ways. ‘Evidence of this (more serious sins) is the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, about them on their being brought together in fire, “The last group will accuse the first saying, ‘Lord, they made us go astray. Therefore, double their torment in the Fire . . .’” (7:38) They will condemn and accuse each other. They argue in the hope of winning but there will be no winning, trial or acceptance of excuses and there will be no way to safety. Such verses and similar other ones were revealed in Makka. Allah does not send to fire anyone except the pagans. ‘When Allah granted Muhammad permission to leave Makka for Madina he spoke of Islam having five principles: ‘To testify that no one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger, that performing the prayer, paying al-Zakat (charity), Hajj of the House and fasting in the month of Ramadan are obligatory. That Allah sent to him judicial rules, and the rules for the distribution of inheritance, and informed him of the sins for which Allah has made it obligatory to punish in fire those who commit such sins. About the murder He has revealed, “The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hellfire forever. Allah is angry with him and has condemned him. He has prepared for him a great torment.” (4:93) ‘Allah does not condemn the believers. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “Allah has condemned the unbelievers and prepared for them a burning torment (33:64) wherein they will live forever without being able to find any guardian or helper.” (33:65) ‘Committing murder does not come from His wish; His anger and condemnation apply to the murderer by sending him to fire. In the book he (murderer) is condemned. About the properties of the orphans that are consumed unjustly He has said, “Those who wrongfully consume the property of orphans are, in fact, consuming fire in their bellies and they will suffer the blazing fire.” (4: 10) ‘On the Day of Judgment, those who consume such properties unjustly will come when fire will be blazing in their bellies so much so that it will come out of their mouth. All the people in the gathering will learn that they are wrongful consumer of orphan’s properties. ‘About measurement for transactions He has said, “ Wayl , a place in hell, is for those who do not maintain proper measurement.” (83:2) He has not said that Wayl is for any kinds of people other than those whom He has called to be of those who reject the faith. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “Wayl ’is for those who reject faith and belief. The unbelievers shall face a woeful condition on the great Day (of Judgment).” (19:37) ‘About the covenant Allah has said: “Those who sell their covenant with Allah and their promises for a small price will have no share in the life hereafter. Allah on the Day of Judgment will not speak to them nor will He look at them nor will He purify them. They will face a painful torment.” (3:77) ‘If someone will have no share on the Day of Judgment then by what means would he enter paradise? ‘The following was revealed in Madina. “No one should marry a (male) fornicator except a (female) fornicator or a pagan woman. No one should marry a (female) fornicator except a (male) fornicator or a pagan man. Such (marriage) is unlawful to the believers.” (24:3) ‘Allah has not called a male or female fornicator a believer. People of knowledge do not doubt what the Messenger of Allah has said to them: “At the time of committing fornication a male or female is not a believer, a thief, male or female is not a believer at the time of committing theft and if one does commit theft one is devoid of belief. It is like a shirt removed from one’s body.” The following verse of the Quran was revealed in Madina: “Those who accuse married women of committing adultery, but are not able to prove their accusation by producing four witness, must be flogged eighty lashes. Never accept their testimony thereafter; they are sinful, (24:4) except that of those who afterwards repent and reform themselves; Allah is All- forgiving and All-merciful.” (24:5) ‘Allah has not called an accuser a believer. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “Is a believer equal to an evildoer? They are not equal at all.” (32:18) ‘Allah had made him a hypocrite. As Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “The hypocrites indeed are evildoers.” (9:67) ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has made them of the friends of Satan as He has said, . . except lblis. He was a Jinn and he sinned against the command of his Lord. . . .” (18:50) ‘Allah called him ‘condemned’ in his words, “Those who slander the unaware but chaste and believing women (of committing unlawful carnal relations) are condemned in this life and in the life hereafter. They will suffer a great punishment (24:23) on the day when their tongues, hands and feet will testify to what they have done.” (24:24) ‘Parts of the body do not testify against a believer. They testify against those who have become subject to punishment. However, the believers will receive the book of their account in their right hand as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “. . . those whose records of deeds are given to their right hands will read the book and the least wrong will not be done to them.” (17:71) ‘Chapter 24 was revealed after Chapter 4. There is evidence for this in what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, sent down to him (Muhammad) in Chapter 4 as follows: “Agaisnt those of your women who commit fornication, let four (Muslim) witness testify to their act. If there is sufficient testimony, confine them to their homes until they die, or until Allah provides a way for their freedom.” (4:15) ‘The path is what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “This is a Chapter which We have revealed to you and made obligatory for you to following its guidance. We have revealed clear verses in it so that perhaps you may take heed. (24:1) “Flog the (female) fornicator and the (male) fornicator with a hundred lashes each. Let there be no reluctance in enforcing the laws of Allah, if you have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment. Let it take place in the presence of a group of believers.”’” (24:2) ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Bakr ibn Salih from al-Qasim ibn Burayd who has said that narrated to us abu ‘Amr al-Zubayri who has said the following: “I said to abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) ‘O scholar, tell me which deed is more virtuous before Allah?’ He said, ‘It is the deed without which Allah does not accept any (deed).’ I asked, ‘What is such a thing?’ He said, ‘Belief in Allah besides whom no one deserves to be worshipped. It (belief) is the highest in degree among the deeds, the most valuable among them and the topmost among them in (matters of) reward.’ I then said, ‘Please, tell me then about belief, is it deeds or it is words without deeds?’ “He said, ‘All of belief is deeds and certain parts of such deeds are words. Allah has made it obligatory as is explained in His book. Its light is clear, its evidence well established. The (Holy) book testifies to it for one, and calls one to it.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, explain it to me so I may understand.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Belief is of degrees, conditions, levels and stages. Of belief there is that which is perfect and complete in perfection. Of belief there is that which is defective and the defect is clear. Of belief there is that which is heavier on the perfection side.’ I then asked, ‘Does belief become perfect, decrease and increase?’ He said, ‘Yes, it does.’ I then asked, ‘How does it happen?’ He said, ‘It is because Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, has written belief for each part of the body of the children of Adam and has divided and distributed it among them. There is no part of thier body but that has a guard of belief different from such guard assigned to other parts. Of such part is one’s heart, with which one understands and reasons to comprehend, and it is the commander of his body. It oversees the body and without its opinion no part moves to act. Of the parts of the body are one’s eyes with which one sees and his ears with which one listens. There are one’s hands with which one works, one’s legs with which one walks, one’s sexual organs from which comes carnal desires, one’s tongue with which one speaks and one’s head on which there is one’s face. For each of these parts a different guard of belief is assigned. It is all due to what Allah, Most Blessed is Whose name, has written, to which His Holy book speaks and testifies. ‘For each of these parts a different obligation is written. The obligation of the heart is different from the obligation of the ears. What is made obligatory for the ears is different from the obligation of the eyes and what is made obligatory for the eyes is different from what is made obligatory for the tongue. What is made obligatory for the tongue is different from what is made obligatory for the hands and what is made obligatory for the hands is different from what is made obligatory for the legs. The obligation of the legs is different from the obligations of the sexual organs. What is obligatory for the sexual organs is different from the obligation of the face. ‘What is made obligatory for the heart of belief is affirmation, recognition and the formation of belief, consent and submission to the fact that no one deserves to be worshipped except Allah Who is One and has no partner. He is the One and only. He has not taken any companion and children. That Muhammad is His servant and messenger, he and his family being recipients of Divine supreme covenant, and to affirm that whatever he has brought is from Allah, be it about a prophet or a book. That is what Allah has made obligatory for the heart; the task of affirmation and recognition, which is its deed. This is stated in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, “. . . but his heart is confident about his faith. However, those whose breasts have become open to disbelief will be subject to the wrath of Allah and will suffer a great torment.” (16: 106) ‘Allah has said, “. . . Remembrance (speaking) of Allah certainly brings comfort to all hearts.” (13:28) ‘Allah has said, “. . . They only say that they believe but, in fact, they have no faith in their hearts. . . .” (5:41) ‘Allah has said, ‘‘Allah will call you to account for all that you may reveal from your souls and all that you may conceal. Allah will forgive or punish whoever He wants. . . .” (2:284) ‘These are what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has made obligatory on the hearts of affirmation and recognition, and these are its deeds and this is the head of the belief. ‘On the tongue Allah has made it obligatory to speak and express what the heart has established and has confirmed as Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, has said, “ . . . that they should speak righteous words to people . . .” (2:83) ‘Allah has said, “Tell them, we believe in Allah and in what is revealed to us and to you. Our Lord and your Lord are one. We have submitted ourselves to His will.” (29:46) ‘This is what Allah has made obligatory for the tongue and this is its deed. He has made it obligatory for the ears to keep it clean from what is unlawful to listen to, and to keep away from things that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has prohibited to listen to attentively; it angers Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy. And in this regard He has said, “Allah has told you (believers) in the Book that when you hear people disbelieving and mocking Allah’s revelations, do not sit with them unless they change the subject . . .” (4: 140) ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, then has made an exception for the case of forgetfulness, ‘If Satan causes you to forget this, do not sit with the unjust people when you recall.” ( 6 : 68 ) ‘Allah has also said, “(Muhammad), give the glad news to those of My servants who listen to the words and follow only the best ones. Tell them that they are those whom Allah has guided. They are the people of understanding.” (39:18) ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “Triumphant indeed are the believers, (23:1) who are submissive to Allah in their prayers, (23:2) who avoid impious talks (23:3) and pay al- Zakat (charity).” (23:4) ‘Allah has said, “When they hear impious words, they ignore them, saying, ‘We shall be responsible for our deeds and you will be responsible for yours. . . (28:55) ‘Allah has said, “. . . when they come across something impious, they pass it by nobly.” (25:72) ‘This is what Allah has made obligatory for the ears in relation to belief; that they must not listen to what is unlawful to listen to, and such matters are of its deeds, which is of belief. He has made it obligatory for the eyes not to look at things He has made unlawful to look at and to stay away from what Allah has prohibited of the things that are not lawful for them. Such things are of their deeds and of belief. ‘Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, has said, “(Muhammad), tell the believing men to cast down their eyes and guard their carnal desires.” (24:30) ‘Allah has prohibited looking at the privacy of one’s brother and to keep one’s privacy protected from the onlookers. Allah has said, “. . .Tell the believing woman to cast down their eyes, guard their chastity (private parts).” (24:31) ‘They must find protection against being looked upon and keep away from looking at their sisters (private parts). The Imam said that everywhere in the Holy Quran where protection of private parts is mentioned it is a reference to fornication except this verse which is a reference to looking. ‘Allah has spoken about the obligations of the heart, tongue, ears and eyes in another verse also: “You did not (think to) hide your deeds from your ears, eyes and skin and you felt that Allah would not know all that you had been doing.” (41 :22) ‘Skin is reference to private parts and thighs. Allah has said, “Do not follow what you do not know; the ears, eyes, and hearts will all be held responsible for their deeds.” (17:36) ‘This is what Allah has made obligatory for the eyes; to cast down away from what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has prohibited. This is their deed and it is of belief. Allah has made it obligatory for the hands not to move to what He has prohibited, instead move to what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has commanded to move to such as charity, good relation with relatives and striving for the cause of Allah and cleansing for prayer. ‘Allah has said, “Believers, when you are about to pray, wash your face and your hands along with the elbows and wipe your head and your feet to the ankles. . . .” (5:6) ‘Allah has said, “If you encounter the unbelievers in a battle, strike-off their heads. Take them as captives when they are defeated. Then you may set them free as a favor to them, with or without a ransom, when the battle is over. . . .” (47:4) ‘This is what Allah has made obligatory for the hands; striking is their task. Allah has made it obligatory for the legs not to walk to what is made unlawful and in disobedience to Allah. He has made it obligatory for them to walk to what makes Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, happy. Allah has said, “Do not walk proudly on the earth; your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains.” (17:37) “Do not walk around inflated with pride; be moderate in your walking and your talking. The most unpleasant sound is the braying of donkeys.” (31:19) ‘About the testifying of the hands and legs against their ownselves and their master for their disregard of the commands of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, and the obligation upon them, Allah has said: “. . . this Day, We seal their mouths and their hands will speak to Us and their feet will testify to what they had achieved.” (36:65) ‘This also is what Allah has made obligatory for the hands and the legs and this is their deed and it is of belief. Allah has made it obligatory for the face to prostrate before Him in the days and nights in the times of the prayers. Allah has said, “Believers, worship your Lord, bow down and prostrate yourselves before Him and do virtuous deeds so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness.” (22:77) ‘This is an obligation that involves the face, hands and legs. In another passage He has said, ‘All the parts of the body to be placed on the ground during prostration belong to Allah. Do not prostrate before anyone other than Him. . . .” (72:18) It was in regards to the obligations upon the parts of the body in the form of purification for prayer that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, made His prophet to change facing the Holy House in Palestine to facing al-Ka’ba. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, revealed this: “Allah did not want to make your previous belief (prayers) worthless; Allah is Compassionate and All- Merciful to people.” (2:143) He has called prayer ‘Belief.’ Therefore, whoever meets Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, perfecting his belief is of the people of paradise. Whoever cheats in any of the obligations or violates the commands of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, will meet Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, with a defective belief.’ “I then asked the Imam, ‘I now understand perfect and defective belief. Where does the increase in belief come from?’ The Imam said, ‘Consider the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, “When a Chapter (of the Quran) is revealed, certain people ask others, ‘Whose belief among you people has received strength from this (revelation)?’ It (the revelation) certainly strengthens the belief of the believers and they consider it to be glad news. (9:124) But to those whose hearts are sick, it adds more filth to their hearts and they die as unbelievers.” (9:125) Allah has said, “. . .We tell you this story for a genuine purpose. They were young people who believed in their Lord and We gave them further guidance.” (18:13) ‘Had belief been the same and without any difference in defects and in perfections no one of them would have had any distinction over the others and the favors would have been equal to all. People had been all equal and excellence would become void. However, with perfection in belief believers enter paradise. By increase in belief the believers excel in degrees before Allah and for the defect in belief the extremists go in fire.’” ",

Certain individuals of our people have narrated from Ali ibn ‘Abbas from Ali ibn Maysir from Hammad ibn al-Nusaybi who has said the following: “A man asked the scholar (a.s.) ‘O scholar, tell me which deed is more virtuous before Allah?’ He said, ‘It is the deed without which Allah does not accept any deed.’ He asked, ‘What is such thing?’ He said, ‘It is belief in Allah (besides Whom no one deserves to be worshipped). It (belief) is the highest in degree among the deeds, the most valuable among them (in virtue) and the topmost among them in reward.’ The man then said, ‘Please, tell me then about belief. Is it deeds or it is words without deeds?’ “The Imam said, ‘All of belief is deeds and parts of such deeds are words. Allah has made it obligatory as is explained in His book. Its light is clear, its evidence well established. The (Holy) book testifies to it for one, and calls one thereto.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘Explain it to me so I may understand.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Belief is of degrees, conditions, levels and stages. Of belief there is that which is perfect and complete in perfection. Of belief there is that which is defective and the defect is clear. Of belief there is that which is heavier on the perfection side.’ The man then asked, ‘Does belief become perfect, decrease and increase?’ He said, ‘Yes, it does.’ The man then asked, ‘How does it happen?’ He said, ‘It is because Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, has written belief for each part of the body of the children of Adam and has divided and distributed it among them. There is no part of the parts but that has a guard of belief that is different from such guard as is assigned to other parts. Of such part is one’s heart with which one understands and rationalizes to comprehend, and he is the commander of one’s body. It oversees the body and without its opinion no part moves to act. Of the parts of the body are one’s hands with which one works, one’s legs with which one walks, one’s sexual organs from which come carnal desires, one’s tongue with which one speaks of the book and testfies thereby, one’s eyes with which one sees and one’s ears with which one listens. ‘For each of these parts a different obligation is written. The obligation of the heart is different from the obligation of the tongue. What is made obligatory for the tongue is different from the obligation of the eyes and what is made obligatory for the eyes is different from what is made obligatory for the ears. What is made obligatory for the ears is different from what is made obligatory for the hands and what is made obligatory for the hands is different from what is made obligatory for the legs. The obligation of the legs is different from the obligations of the sexual organs. What is obligatory for the sexual organs is different from the obligation of the face. ‘What is made obligatory for the heart of belief is affirmation, recognition and formation of belief, consent and submission to the fact that no one deserves to be worshipped except Allah Who is One and has no partner. He is the One and only Who deserves to be worshipped. He has not taken any companion and children. Muhammad (a.s.) is His servant and messenger.’” ",

Muhammad ibn al-Hassan has narrated from certain individuals of our people from al-Ash’ath ibn Muhammad from Muhammad ibn Hafs ibn Kharija who has said the following: “I heard abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) saying - when a man asked him about the words of al-Murji’a, a religious sect, about rejection (disbelief) and belief -, ‘They argue against us and say, “Just as to us one who disbelieves is a rejecter of belief, so also is he in the sight of Allah. The same applies to a believer. We find a believer that when he affirms his belief he is a believer in the sight of Allah.” He (a.s.) said, “Glory belongs to Allah. How can these two be equal? Rejection of belief is an affirmation and confession of a servant, and thereafter he is not required to present any witness to prove his case. (On the other hand) belief is a claim, which is not accepted without the testimony of a witness. Witness to prove his case is his deed and intention. If they (deed and intention) agree, a servant is a believer in the sight of Allah. Rejection of belief exists in all the three things; word, deed and intention and rules of law apply to both word and deed. In of favor many persons believers testify to prove them to be believers and the rules of law applicable to believers are applied to them, but in the sight of Allah they are rejecters of belief. In certain conditions one’s applying rules of law, applicable to believers, to such unbelievers is also correct according to the apparent condition of his deed and words.’”” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Bakr ibn Salih from al-Qasim ibn Burayd who has said that abu ‘ Amr al-Zubayri who has said the following: “I asked abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) ‘Are there degrees and stages of belief in which the believers may excel in the sight of Allah?’ He said, ‘Yes, there are.’ 1 then said, ‘Explain to me, please, may Allah grant you favors, so I can understand.’ The Imam said, ‘Allah has set a contest among the believers like the contest set for horses. He then has given degrees of excellence for those who excel to win. For each contestant there He has set a level and everyone receives (a reward) exactly to the degree he has achieved. Those left behind do not go ahead of those who have advanced forward and have excelled others. Such was the case of the people who lived in the earliest period of the history of this nation and those who lived later. Had there been no distinction for those advanced in belief over those behind, the last of this nation could catch up with those of the earliest times of this nation. This certainly happens if those advancing in belief are given no distinction over those slow in their progress for belief. ‘In fact, by the degrees of belief Allah has given preference to the advancing ones, and due to slow progress in (matters of) belief Allah has left back those with shortcomings in belief. We find that of the believers of the later (generations) there are those who have many more (good) deeds than those of the earlier (generations), more prayer, fasting, Hajj al-Zakat (charity), hard work (Jihad) for the cause of Allah. Were it not for advancing being considered reason for distinction among the believers in the sight of Allah, those of later (generations) would have had superiority over those earlier, due to more deeds. However, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, abstains from allowing the last, in degrees of belief, to reach the first and forward ones. It amounts to forwarding those whom Allah has made to be the last, and throwing back those whom Allah has made to be forward. ‘I then said, “Tell me about Allah’s call on the believers to advance in belief.’’ The Imam said, ‘It is in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, “Compete with one another to achieve forgiveness from your Lord and to reach paradise, which is as vast as the heavens and the earth, and is prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. . . .” (58:21) Allah has said, “(The foremost ones) will be the nearest ones to Allah.’’ (56:11) Allah has said, “Allah is well pleased with the foremost ones of those who left their homes for the cause of Allah, those who helped them after their arrival in Medina and those who nobly followed these two groups. . . .” (9:100) ‘He (Allah) has begun with the first immigrants according to the degree of their advancing. He then has spoken of the Ansars (first Muslims of Madina) and thirdly He has spoken of the second generation who followed them in good deeds. He has placed each group according to their degrees and stages in the sight of Allah. Thereafter Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has mentioned the degrees of His friends (messengers) of whom there are those who excel over the others. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “We gave certain ones of Our Messengers preference over others. To others of them Allah spoke and He raised the rank of a number of them. . . .” (2:253) ‘Allah has said, “We have given preference to certain prophets over others and We gave the psalms to David.” (17:55) Allah has said, “Consider how We have given preference to certain people above others, yet the life to come has more honor and respect.” (17:21) Allah has said, “People are of various grades in the sight of Allah. . . .” (3:163) Allah has said, “He (Allah) will reward everyone according to his merits.” (11:3) Allah has said. “To those who have believed in Allah, left their homes and fought for His cause with their possessions and in person, Allah will grant high ranks and success.” (9:20) ‘Allah has said, “He will grant greater reward to those who strive for His cause than to those who stay home (for no reason). (4:95) Allah will grant to those who strive, high ranks, forgiveness and mercy. . . .” (4:96) Allah has said, “Those who spend for the cause of Allah and fight before victory will have higher positions than those who spend for the cause of Allah and fight after victory. . . .” (57:10) Allah has said, “Allah will raise the position of the believers and of those who have received knowledge. Allah is Well-aware of what you do.” (58:11) ‘Allah has said, “. . . they did not experience any hardships of thirst, fatigue or hunger in their straggle for the cause of Allah, nor has any of their traveling enraged the disbelievers, and they did not receive any injury from enemies for which Allah did not record for them a virtuous deed. . . .” (9:120) Allah has said, “You will receive a good reward from Allah for all your good works. . . .” (2:110) Allah has said, “Whoever has done an atom’s weight of good (99:7) will see it, and whoever has done an atom’s weight of evil will also see it.” (99:8) ‘Such are the stages and degrees of belief in the sight of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy.’” ",

Abu Ali al-Ash’ari has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar from Muhammad ibn Yahya from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa all from ibn Faddal from al-Hassan ibn al-Jahm from abu al-Yaqzan from Ya’qub ibn al-Dahhak from a man of our people, Sarraj who was a servant of abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) has said the following: “ Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) once sent me with a group of his followers for an errand and at that time he was in Hirah (a place near Kufa, Iraq). We left for it and returned depressed. My bed was in al-Ha’ir (a comfortable private quarter). I went there in an upset condition and threw myself thereat. At this time abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) came in saying, ‘We have come to see you,’ or he said, ‘We have come to you.’ I then sat up straight and he sat in the middle of my bed and asked me about the errand for which he had sent me. I reported to him and he thanked Allah. Thereafter, a mention of certain people came up and I said, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, we disassociate from these people; they do not say what we say.’ The Imam then said, ‘If they love and support us, but do not say what you say, do you (still) disassociate from them?’ I then said, ‘Yes, we do so.’ “The Imam said, ‘It is just like this (’ A’immah’s case). We have what you do not have. Should we disassociate from you?’ I then said, ‘No, may Allah keep my soul in service for your cause.’ The Imam said, ‘It is just like this (the case of Allah). With Him there is what we do not have. Do you think we should give it up?’ “I then said, ‘No, may Allah keep my soul in service for your cause. We should not do so.’ The Imam said, ‘Be friends with them and do not disassociate from them. Among the Muslims there are those who have only one share, those who have two shares, three shares, four shares, five shares, six shares and those who have seven shares. It is not proper for those who have one share to blame those who have two shares, or those who have two shares to blame those who have three shares, those who have three shares to blame those who have four shares, those who have four shares to blame those who have five shares, those who have five shares to blame those who have six shares and those who have six shares to blame those who have seven shares. I will give an example: “A man had a Christian neighbor to whom he preached Islam attractively and the neighbor accepted. It was early next morning when he knocked at his (convert’s) door. He said, ‘Who is it?’ He (the preacher) said, ‘I am so and so.’ ‘What do you want?’ the (convert) said. ‘Make Wuzu, dress up in your two cloths and join us for prayer,’ said the preacher. The new convert then made Wuzu, dressed up in his two pieces of cloth and joined him. They performed prayers a great deal. Then they prayed the morning-prayer, then waited until it was light. The convert got up to go home and the man asked him, ‘Where are you going? The day is short. The time left to noontime is very little.’ The new convert sat down with him until noontime and they prayed the noontime prayer. Then he said that there is very little time to afternoon prayer. He prevented the new convert from going home until they said the afternoon prayer. He then wanted to go home but he (the preacher) said, ‘It is the last part of the day and is less than the beginning of it.’ So he (the preacher) stopped him until they performed the prayer at sunset. Then the new convert wanted to go home, he (the preacher) said, ‘Only one more prayer is left.’ He then waited until they performed the late evening prayer and then they departed each other. Next early morning he (the preacher) went and knocked at the door of the new convert. He (the new convert) asked, ‘Who is it?’ He (the preacher) said, ‘I am so and so.’ He (the new convert) asked, ‘What do you want?’ He (the preacher) said, ‘Make Wuzu, dress up in your two pieces of cloth and join us for prayer.’ He (the Christian man) said, ‘Find other persons for this religion who have more free time. I am a poor person with a family to feed.’ “Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) then said, ‘He (the preacher) took him (Christian) into a thing in such a way that it took him (the new convert) out of it. Or that the Imam said, ‘Took him in like this and forced him out like that.’” ",

He is dignified in turbulent times. He is patient in afflicting conditions. He is thankful in prosperous life. He is content with what Allah has granted him. He does not do injustice to the enemies. He does not overburden friends. His own body is tired due to his efforts and people are comfortable with him. Knowledge is a friend of the believer, forbearance is his secretary, reason is the commander-in-chief of his army, kindness is his brother and virtuous deed is his father.” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from his father from those whom he has mentioned from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn abu Layla from his father from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “You will not become virtuous until you learn, you will not learn until you affirm and you will not affirm until you accept four Chapters, the first of which will be of no benefit without the last one. People of three Chapters have strayed far away. Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, does not accept anything but virtuous deeds and Allah does not accept (anything) without loyalty in keeping up with one’s stipulations and covenants. Whoever fulfils his stipulations toward Allah and completes whatever is in one’s covenant, he will find (the reward that is) with Him and He will fulfill His promise. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has informed the people of the ways of guidance and has established for it the lighthouse. He has informed them how to behave, saying, ‘I am All-forgiving to the righteously striving believers who repent and follow the right guidance.’ (20:82) Allah has also said, ‘Allah accepts only the offerings of the pious ones.’ (5:27) “Whoever maintains piety before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, in the matter of His commands he will come in the presence of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, as a believer in whatever Muhammad (a.s.) has brought from Him. How remote, far away and lost are the people who have died before achieving guidance, and had thought that they were believers. They had considered things as partners of Allah without knowing what they had done. Whoever comes to a house through its door finds proper guidance, and whoever looks for a way other than the door has chosen a condemned path. Allah has joined obedience to His Messenger with obedience to those who possess Divine Authority and the obedience to His Messenger with obedience to His own commands. Therefore, whoever does not obey the people who possess Divine Authority, they have not obeyed Allah and His Messenger and it (obedience to people who possess Divine Authority) is the affirmation of what has come from Allah. Dress up (in piety) before every Mosque. Find the houses through the doors to them, the houses for which Allah has granted permission to be raised high, wherein people speak of Him. He has informed you that in these houses there are men who do not become distracted because of trade and business from speaking of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, from prayer and paying al-Zakat (charity). These men fear the Day wherein the hearts and eyes undergo turbulent conditions. Allah chose and purified the messengers for His command, then He purified and chose them (people who possess Divine Authority) who are confirmed in His warnings. Allah has said, ‘No nation who lived before was left without a Warner. . . .’ (35:25) “Lost are those who remained ignorant and guided are those who thought and understood. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘It is not their seeing ability that is blind but it is their hearts which are in their chests.’ (22:46) “How can one who does not think find guidance? How can one who has not received warnings think? Follow the Messenger of Allah, affirm whatever has come from Allah, follow the marks of guidance; they are the signs of trust and piety. You must know that if a man rejects Jesus Christ and acknowledges all the other messengers of Allah, he is not a believer. Find the way through finding the lighthouse and look for the marks from behind the curtains. Strive to perfect the affairs of your religion and believe in Allah your Lord.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Muhammad ibn Yahya from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa and a number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid all from al-Hassan ibn Mahbub from Ya’qub al-Sarraj from Jabir from Abu Ja’far (a.s.) and through various chain of narrators from Asbagh ibn Nubatah who has said the following: “Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) once addressed us at his home or - that he said - in the castle, and we were all gathered. He (may Allah’s favors be with him) issued a written order that was read to people. Others have narrated that ibn al-Kawwa asked Amir al- Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) to describe Islam, belief, rejection and hypocrisy. He then said, ‘(First I express my thanks to and praise of Allah), thereafter (I must say that) Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, established Islam and made its paths clear for the people coming in Islam. He gave strength to its corners against the enemies. He made it (to be a source of) dignity for those who love it, peace for those who enter therein, guidance for those who follow it, beauty for those who glorify it, protection for those who accept it, a stronghold for those who seek security, a rope for those who like to hold on to it, solid proof for those who speak from it, light for those who search for brightness, a rescuer for those who cry for help, a witness for those who fight for it, success for those who argue by the facts therein, knowledge for those who imbibe it, good report for those who narrate it, judgment for those who take it as the source of decrees, forbearance for those who experience it, a dress for those who contemplate on it, understanding for those who find good points in it, certainty for those who reason with it, insight for those who make a decision, a sign for those who take it as landmark, a good lesson for those who look for good lessons, salvation for those who affirm it, serenity for those who reform, success for those who come close to it, confidence for those who trust it, ease for those who make it the factor-in-charge of thier affairs, advancement for those who do it well, goodness for those who come to it fast, a shield for those who bear patience, dressing for those who observe piety, a supporter for those who take it as a guide, a cave of protection for those who seek safety, peace and comfort for those who accept it, hope for those who believe it and self-sufficiency for those who are content. That is the truth. Its path is guidance, its narratives are honorable and its description is goodness. Its system is clear, its lighthouse shines, its lamp is clean and bright, its aims are high, its training is easy and its advancing is a great deal. Its advancing is quick and its disciplining painful. Its assets are sufficient and its staff honorable. Belief is its system, virtuous deeds are its lighthouse, laws and understanding are the sources of its light, the world is its arena and death is its end, the hereafter its reward, paradise its finish line, hell its resentment, piety its supplies and people of good deeds its soldiers. Through belief good deeds are found, with good deeds good understanding is achieved and with good understanding fear for death is felt and with death the world ends. With the world one reaches the Day of Judgment. On the Day of Judgment paradise is bedecked. Paradise is (the cause of) regret for people of hell. Hell is a good lesson for the pious people and piety is the foundation of belief.” ",

Through the same chain of narrators as the above Hadith it is narrated from ibn Mahbub from Ya’qub al-Sarraj from Jabir from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) was asked about belief and he said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, made belief upon four pillars: ‘Patience, Certainty, Justice and Jihad (hard work for the cause of Allah). ‘The Patience therein has four branches: nostalgia, fear, restraint and vigilance. One who has a longing for paradise forgets the worldly desires. One who has fear of hell abstains from unlawful things. One who exercises restraint in worldly matters the worldly hardships become easier for him, and one who is vigilant of death hastens to good deeds. ‘The Certainty therein is also of four branches. They consist of sharp understanding, proper application of wisdom, recognizing good lessons and knowledge of the traditions of the people of the past. One who possesses sharp understanding recognizes the matters of wisdom. One who applies wisdom properly recognizes the good lessons, and one who recognizes the good lessons recognizes the traditions, and one who recognizes traditions is like the one who has lived with the people of the past and has found proper and firm guidance. He has seen who found salvation and by what means they found. He has also seen those who were destroyed and things that destroyed them. Allah destroys only those who disobey Him and grants salvation for ones obedience to His commands. ‘The Justice therein is also of four branches. It is a matter of deep understanding, a huge body of knowledge, the bloom of wisdom and the garden of forbearance. One who has deep understanding has the ability to interpret all knowledge. One who has a huge body of knowledge knows the ways of wisdom, and one who is forbearing is not an extremist in his decrees and lives among the people with a good name. ‘The Jihad (hard work for the cause of Allah) therein, is also of four branches. They consist of helping others to perform their duties and to stay away from that which is prohibited, to speak the truth whenever needed and to shun sins and sinners. One who helps others to perform their duties has supported the believer. One who helps stop others from sinning has humiliated the hypocrites and has thwarted their wicked plans. One who speaks the truth at the right time, his is the winning side. One who shuns the sinners has used anger for Allah. One who becomes angry for Allah, Allah becomes angry for him. Such is belief, its pillars and branches.’” ",

It is also as if I am looking at the people of hell wherein they suffer and cry for help. Right now, it is as if I hear the roaring of the fire.

I try them by means of wealth, comfort and good health and this makes their religious affairs to be in the best condition. Also among My believing servants there are those whose religious lives are only at their best with poverty, destitution and ailing health.

Among My believing servants there are those who strive to worship Me. They wake up from sleep leaving their comfortable pillow for Tahajjud (special prayer at night). They experiences fatigue and I allow slumber overcome them on one or two nights, a trial from Me to see if he continues, he goes to sleep and wakes up upset and angry over his own self. If I allow him to do the way he wants to worship, he may develop a sense of conceit (unwanted pride) that can lead him to mischief in his deeds. This may bring about his destruction. It can so happen due to his happiness with whatever his soul desires. He may begin to feel as if he has excelled all worshippers and has surpassed the limits of defective worship.

Even if they strive hard, tire themselves and finish their lives worshipping Me they fall short, in worshipping Me truly, in their quest for My generous rewards, My bounties in paradise and high positions near Me. They must only trust in My mercy, be happy with My generosity and always be hopeful about Me.

I said, ‘So and so will look after my needs.’ He then said, ‘I swear by Allah, you will not get what you need and you will not achieve what you hope to achieve.’ I then asked, ‘How do you know, may Allah grant you favors?’ He said, ‘Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) told me that he has read in a certain book that Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, has said, “I swear by My Majesty, by My Glory, by My Greatness, by My Highness over My Throne, I will turn the hopes of all who hope in people other than Me into hopelessness, and I will dress him with the clothe of humiliation before the people, and move him away from nearness to Me. I will move him away from My additional favors. How dare he expects help from others in hardship? All hardships are under My control. He expects others to help him. He knocks on the door of the others and the key to all closed doors is in My hand and My door is open for those who pray to Me. Who is he that hopes to receive help from Me in his difficulties and I have left him in hardship? Is there anyone who had hopes in Me in a great hardship and I cutoff his hopes in Me? I have placed the hopes of My servants safe with Me. They did not agree with My safeguarding their interests. I have filled up My heavens with those who never tire from speaking of My Glory. I have commanded them not to close the doors between Me and My servants. They did not trust My words. Do they not know that if I afflict one with My hardships no one have the ability to remove them without My permission. “Why is it then that 1 see him mindless of Me? I granted him favor without his asking, then I removed the favor and he did not ask Me to return it but he asked others. Has he not seen Me grant favors even before asking. How would I refuse My favors when I am asked for a favor? Am I stingy and do My servants consider Me as such? Do generosity and benevolence not originate from Me? Are not forgiveness and kindness in My hand? Am I not the center of hopes? Who is he that cuts off his hopes from Me? Are those who cut off their hopes from Me not afraid of placing their hopes in others? If the inhabitants of My heavens and the inhabitants of My earth would all have hopes in Me and I then grant each one equal to that which all of them wished to have, no shortages would take place in my kingdom even to the size of an atom. How can there be any shortages in the kingdom that I Myself am the keeper of? How hopeless is the case of those who cut off their hopes from Me? How hopeless is the case of those who disobey Me and do not expect anything from Me?’”” ",

Everyone on board died except his wife who clung to a board and landed on an island where there lived a robber who had left no instance of disobedience to Allah but had committed them all. Without knowing anything about the shipwreck he found the woman standing over his head. He raised his head and asked her, ‘Are you a human being or a Jinni?’ She replied, ‘I am a human being. ’ He then did not say any other word but began to behave like a husband. When he advanced for a carnal relation she panicked. He asked, ‘Why have you panicked?’ She said, ‘I am afraid of this, pointing to the heavens.’ He then asked, ‘Have you done any such thing wrong against Him?’ She said, ‘No, I swear by His Glory that I have not done any such thing against Him.’ He then said, ‘You fear Him this much when you have done nothing against Him and it is only I that force you into this. In fact, I swear by Allah, I am the one who must be afraid of Him more so than you are.’ The robber then moved away without speaking a word and went back to his family. He then had no other aim but to repent and return to Allah. Once as he was walking on the road, a monk joined him walking in the same direction. The day was hot and the monk suggested that they should pray to Allah to send them a piece of cloud to provide shade against the hot sun. The young man (once a robber) said, ‘I do not think I have any good deed with my Lord so I dare not pray to Him.’ The monk said, ‘I pray and you say, Amen.’ He agreed and the monk began to pray and the young man said the Amen part. Quickly a piece of cloud appeared and provided them a shadow. They walked comfortably under the shadow against the sun. The road then divided and the young man walked in one road and the monk in the other one. The shadow went along over the young man. The monk said, ‘You are better than me. The prayer was accepted because of you, not because of me. Now tell me what is your story?’ The young man told him the story of the woman. The monk said, ‘Your sins of the past are forgiven because of fear that entered in your heart. Pay proper attention to your future behaviors.’” ",

Everything that may take you closer to hell and farther away from paradise I have prohibited you to do. You must know that the trusted spirit has inspired me that no soul dies before his supply of sustenance is completely exhausted.

Abu Ali al-Ash’ari has narrated from Muhammad ibn Salim and Ahmad ibn abu ‘Abd Allah from his father all from Ahmad ibn al-Nadr from ‘Amr ibn Shamir from Jabir from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “O Jabir, do people think just claiming to be our Shi’a and saying they love us ( Ahl al-Bayt) is enough for their salvation? I swear by Allah, of our Shi’a are only those who are pious before Allah and obey Him. No one, O Jabir, would know them except by their humbleness, submissiveness, trustworthiness, their speaking frequently of Allah, fasting, prayer, virtuous deeds toward parents, good relations with neighbors, the needy, the destitute, the heavily indebted, the orphans, by their truthfulness, recitation of the Holy Quran, and restraining of their tongues except for the good of the people and their being trusted among the people of their tribe in all things. I (Jabir) then said, ‘O descendent of the Messenger of Allah, today we do not find anyone with such qualities.’ The Imam said, ‘O Jabir, do not allow (false) religions confuse you. One should not think, since he loves Ali (a.s.) and supports him, thereafter he does not have to be active in anything. If one says he loves the Messenger of Allah who is better than Ali (a.s.) but does not follow his way of life or practice his tradition, his love as such is of no benefit for him. You must be pious before Allah and work to achieve things that exist with Allah. There is no family relation between one and Allah. The most beloved one to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, is the most noble before Him, the most pious ones before Him and the most obedient ones to Him. O Jabir, I swear by Allah, nothing helps one to become nearer to Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, except obedience to Him. There is no immunity from hell and no one possesses any authority over Allah. Only those who obey Allah, they are our supporters. Whoever is disobedient to Allah, is our enemy. Our guardianship applies only to those who do good deeds and maintain restraint over their desires for worldly things.’” ",

If you respond (to evil acts) by virtuous ones, you will certainly find that your enemies will become your intimate friends (41:34). Only those who exercise patience and who have been granted a great share of Allah’s favor can find such an opportunity.” (41:35) The Messenger of Allah exercised patience in suffering and hardships even when they (pagans) attacked him with bones (of large animals). He became very depressed, and Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, revealed to him, “We certainly know that you feel sad about what they say against you (15:97). Glorify and praise your Lord and be with those who prostrate themselves before Allah.” (15:98) They (pagans) rejected his message and caused him physical suffering so he became depressed. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, sent him these words, “We certainly know that you (Muhammad) are sad about what they (the unbelievers) say. It is not you (alone) who has been accused of lying. The unjust have always rejected Allah’s revelations. (6:33) The Messengers who lived before you were also accused of lying, but they exercised patience. They were cruelly persecuted before We gave them victory. . . .” (6:34) The Holy Prophet held to patience firmly and they (pagans) spoke of Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, and called His words as lies. The Messenger of Allah said, “I remained patient about myself, my family and my honor, but I cannot remain quiet when they speak ill of my Lord.” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, revealed to him these words, “We created the heavens, the earth and all that is between them in six days without experiencing any fatigue (50:38). (Muhammad), exercise patience against what they say. . . .” (50:39) The Holy Prophet thereafter exercised patience in all matters and then he was given the good news of Imamat (Divine Authority) given to his descendents who were described as (people) exercising patience. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, “We appointed from them as A ’immah (leaders) for their exercising patience to guide the others to Our commands. They had firm belief in Our revelations.” (32:24) ‘Thereupon the Messenger of Allah said, “Patience is to belief as is the head to the body.” Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, appreciated this and He, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, revealed these words: “Thus, the promises of your Lord to the children of Israel all came true because of the patience which they exercised. He destroyed all the establishments of the Pharaoh and his people.” (7:137) The Messenger of Allah said, “This is good news and compensation.” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, then made it lawful for him to fight the pagans. Allah then revealed these words, “Slay the pagans wherever you find them. Capture, besiege and watch out for them. If they repent, perform prayers and pay the religious tax, set them free. Allah is Allforgiving and All-Merciful.” (9:5). “Then slay them for it is the recompense that the disbelievers deserve.” (2:191) ‘Allah caused them to be killed by the (forces) of the Messenger of Allah and his friends, and made it a reward for his exercising patience in addition to the rewards reserved for him in the next life. Whoever exercises patience nobly will not leave this world before Allah grants him delight to his heart in the matters of his enemies, in addition to the reward that is reserved for him in the next life.’” ",

Would you like me to teach you a Hadith which is not found in the hands of any of the people of Madina?’ I said, ‘Yes, please do so.’ The Imam said, ‘Once the Messenger of Allah was in the Mosque when a girl from the people of Ansar came in and he was standing there. She held to one end of his (the Messenger of Allah’s) cloth, the Holy Prophet stood up. She did not say anything and he (the Holy Prophet) also did not say anything to her (he then sat down). She repeated it three times and at the fourth time the Holy Prophet stood up for her and she was behind him. She then took a piece from his cloth and returned back. People rebuked her saying, “May Allah do to you what He may decide to do. You held the Messenger of Allah as your captive. You did it three times. You said nothing to him nor did he say anything to you. What did you want from him?” She then said, “We had a patient and our people sent me to get a piece from his (the Messenger of Allah’s) cloth to be used to cure the patient. When I wanted to get the piece he saw me and stood up. I then felt shy to take what I wanted when he would see me. I did not like to demand anything from him. At last I took what I wanted to get.’”” ",

Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, inspired the mountains of His decision to allow the ark of Noah, His servant, land on one of the mountains. They all raised and stretched themselves higher. Only Mount Judi which is a mountain near you remained humble. The ark then placed itself on Mount Judi.’ The Imam said, ‘Noah then said, “O Mari atqan,” an Assyrian expression, meaning O Lord, make things go well. ’ I (the narrator) then thought abu al-Hassan (a.s.) was applying it to his own case.’”",

It has many branches. Sins have many branches. The first disobedience to Allah was because of arrogance that Satan committed when he refused boastfully and became of those who reject (the command of Allah). Greed was the sin of Adam and Eve. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘We told Adam to stay with his spouse (Eve) in the garden and enjoy the foods therein. We (also) told them to stay away from going near a certain tree lest they might become one of the transgressors.’ (2:35) They took what they did not need and this remains in their descendents to the Day of Judgment. For this reason most of the things that the children of Adam want they do not need. Then it is jealousy because of which the son of Adam committed disobedience and murdered his brother out of jealousy. From this branch comes love for women, love for the world, love for leadership, love for comfort, love to speak, love for higher position and wealth. They are seven characteristics and all of them are gathered together in the love for the world. The prophets and scholars after knowing this have said: ‘Love for the world is the head of all sins.’ There are two worlds: the world of bare necessities and the condemned world.’” ",

Each world has its sons. Therefore, you must be of the sons of the next world and not the sons of this world. You must be of those who have reduced their interest in worldly matters and of those seriously interested in the next life. You must know that those with reduced interest in worldly matters have taken the earth as their habitat, the soil as their bedding, water as their perfume and have cut themselves off this world in all seriousness.’ “Note that those who are interested in paradise have harnessed their worldly desires and those who are afraid of the fire have turned away from prohibited matters. Whoever reduces his interests in worldly matters, hardships become easy for him. “Note that there are the servants of Allah who are as if they, actually, see the people of paradise in paradise live forever and the people of fire in the fire in huge suffering. Instead of evil coming from them it is absolute peace, the hearts of these servants of Allah are sad, their soul chaste, and their needs are very light. They exercise patience for a few short days followed by a very long lasting comfort. At night they stand up straight with their feet side by side and tears come down their cheeks. They plead before their Lord and struggle to set their neck free (of sins). In the day they are forbearing scholars, very virtuous and pious. They are slim like an arrow without fins; it is caused by their fear (for possible suffering in the next life) during their worship. On looking to them one may think they suffer from illness. They, in fact, have no illness, or any confusion in their reasoning power, but they have plunged into a tremendously great issue; it is the issue of the fire and all that it involves.” ",

        "englishText": "16. It is narrated from him (narrator of the Hadith above) from Ali ibn al-Hakam from abu ‘Abd Allah al-Mu’min from Jabir who has said the following: “Once I went to visit abu la’ far (a.s.) and he said, ‘O Jabir, I swear by Allah, I am very sad and my heart is pre-occupied.’ I then asked, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, what has pre-occupied your heart and what is the reason for your sadness?’ The Imam said, ‘O Jabir, if the religion of Allah in its pure form may enter one’s heart it preoccupies the heart above everything else. O Jabir, what is the world and what can one think it can be? Is it more than food to eat, clothes to wear and a woman whom you may find?’ “O Jabir, the believers are not satisfied with remaining in it (world) and they do not feel safe from the coming of the next life. O Jabir, the next life is the permanent house and this world is finishing and passing but the people of this world are neglectful. The believers are of deep understanding, people of thinking, of learning lessons and their speaking of Allah, Most Glorious is Whose name, is not silenced by means of what their ears hear. Their eyes are not blinded in speaking of Allah due to what they see of the worldly attractions (around). They have suceeded in gaining the rewards of the next life just as they have succeeded in gaining that knowledge. “O Jabir, you must know that people of piety are of smallest expenses and the most helpful to others. If you speak of them they will assist you and if you forget them they will speak of you. They are the most outspoken for the commands of Allah and steadfast in obeying the orders of Allah. They have discontinued their love (for others) with love for their Lord and they have cut themselves off from the world to obey their owner and king. They look to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, and to His love with their hearts, and have learned that this is what they must look at due to its great position. Thus they have considered the world a temporary place to stay and then leave forever, or like a property that one finds in his dream and upon waking finds no trace of it. I give you this example because to people of reason and knowledge of Allah it is like fast-passing shadow. O Jabir, protect what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, expects you to protect of His religion and wisdom. Never ask of things that are for you with Him but ask of His things that are with your soul. If the world is other than what I described for you, then consider it a house (a correctional facility) where you can seek to reform yourself. I swear by my life that many are those who are greedy for a certain matter but it makes them miserable when they achieve it and many are those who dislike a certain matter but it makes them fortunate when they find it. This is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘So that Allah would test the faith of the believers, and deprive the unbelievers of (His) blessings.’” (3:141) Note: “House (correctional facility) and reform” is a reference to verse, 24, 84, 57, 35 and 24 of Chapters, 41, 16, 30, 45 and 41, respectively.

The more it wraps silk around itself the more difficult it becomes for it to get out until at last it dies therein in sorrow.’ The narrator has said that abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) then said, ‘Of the advice of Luqman to his son was this: ‘My son, people before you collected for their children but their collection never remained in place, nor were those for whom the collection was made. You are only a servant for hire. You are ordered to perform a deed and receive payment for it. Do your deed and receive payment. Do not be like the sheep who, finds a green farm and keeps eating until fatness kills it. Take the world as a bridge to cross a river and leave it when you are on the other side. Never return to it until the end of time. Destroy it and never repair it; you are not ordered to build it. “Bear in mind that tomorrow you will be questioned before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, of four things. You will be asked about your youth, how you made it old, about your life span, how you finished it, and about your properties, how you earned them and how you spent them. Wake up for these questions and prepare the answers. Do not regret for what you have missed of worldly things. The little worldly things do not last very long and more of the worldly things are not without misfortune. Be cautious, work hard in your affairs, remove the curtain before you. Get involved in the lawful matters of your Lord, renew repentance in your heart, work hard when you are free and before you are targeted (by the angel of death) for dying and judgment is issued that separates you from your goal.’” ",

O Moses, race in good, the people of goodness and compete with them in goodness; goodness is like its name. Leave alone of worldly matters what is beyond the bare necessities. Do not allow your eyes to look to every attractive matter that is left to its own self (considered as worthless). Note that every misfortune emerges from the love for the world. No one of you should feel excited for great wealth; with bigger wealth sins in the obligatory rights may increase. No one must feel happy because of people’s happiness with him until he learns whether Allah is also happy with him or not. No creature must be excited about people obeying him; people’s obeying him and following him on something other than the right thing is destruction for him as well as his followers.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Yunus from abu Jamilah who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) has said, ‘Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) wrote to one of his companions to advise him. “I recommend that you and I be pious before the One whose disobedience is not lawful. Besides Him, in no one else is placing any hope worthwhile. Sufficiency is not achieveable without Him. Whoever is pious before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, is strong and satisfied with food and drink, his reason soars above the people of the world. His body is with the people of the world, but his heart and power of reason examine the next life. The light of his heart extinguishes what his eyes see of the love of the world. He considers unlawful things in it filthy and stays away from its doubtful things. He, I swear by Allah, suffers losses in even clean lawful matters except small pieces for the bare necessities that keep him standing to survive and clothes, to cover his privacy, of the roughest and thickest quality that he can find. He did not find anything in which to place his trust and hope in the needed circumstances, so he placed his trust and hope in the Creator of all things. He worked hard and struggled intensely, and suffered fatigue until his ribs appeared and his eyes sunk. Allah, then, in exchange for this, strengthened his body and intensified his power of reason. What He has stored for him in the next life is much greater. Reject the world. Love of the world makes one blind, deaf and dumb and it bends the necks in humiliation. Compensate for what is left of your life and do not leave your task for tomorrow or after tomorrow. Those who were before were destroyed because of their dependence on false hope and temptation, until the command of Allah came suddenly when they were neglectful. They were transferred on (pieces of) wood to their dark and narrow graves. Their children and family abandoned them there. He was then left to Allah with a submissive heart. Those who reject the world with firmness will face no defeat or betrayal. May Allah help us and you in obeying Him, and may Allah give us and you the opportunity to do what He likes.’” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from Ya’qub ibn Yazid from Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali in a marfu’ manner from Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) who has said the following: “The Messenger of Allah once passed by a shepherd of camels and asked him for a drink and he said, ‘The milk in their udder is for the morning drink of the people of the village and the milk in the containers is for their evening drink.’ The Messenger of Allah then prayed, ‘O Lord, give him many children and much wealth.’ The Messenger of Allah then passed by a shepherd of sheep and sent his people to ask him for a drink. He milked them and poured it from his milk container altogether in the container for the Messenger of Allah. Along with all the milk he also sent a sheep for him, saying, ‘This is what we have and we can bring you more if you like.’ The Imam said, ‘The Messenger of Allah prayed for him, “O Lord, give him sustenance adequate only for his bare necessities.” A certain man of his companion then asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, how is it that you prayed for the shepherd who refused to give you any milk in such a way that we all love. However, for the one who readily provided what you asked, you prayed for him with a prayer that we all dislike?’ The Messenger of Allah said, ‘The little thing that is adequate is better than a great deal that diverts one’s mind (from Allah). O Lord, grant to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad only that much which is adequate for them.’” ",

Certain men from his companions followed, but they had difficulty catching up with him, and he would slow down for them until he reached the people and offered them greetings of peace. He asked them about their lack of cooperation with one of their own people. They complained before the Imam and he complained against them. Amir al- Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) said, ‘A man must maintain good relations with relatives; they are more deserving of benefitting from his virtuous deeds and achievements. The relatives must maintain good relations with one of their own in times of need when things are against him. Those who maintain good relations with relatives and help financially are rewarded. Those who cut off good relations with relatives and turn away commit a sin.’ The man has said, ‘The Imam then turned his horse around and directed it to move.’” ",

Do not tell anyone of your meeting with me until you will meet me at Mina, if Allah would so will.’ I (the narrator) met him at Mina and people were around him as if he were the teacher of children.

He then will be out of the rights that were established. That which he manifests later suspends his rights unless he then claims it to be for purposes of protection ( Taqiyah ). Despite this, it is to be seen, if it is of the cases where use of protective measures ( Taqiyah ) is applicable or not, if not then his claim is not accepted. For use of protective measures there are specific instances. Whoever misuses them will not have the benefits thereby. Of such examples one is when there are evil people whose rules and judgments are against the judgment and actions of truth. In such conditions, if the believer may use the protective measures to the limits that do not harm ones religion, such use is permissible.’” ",

The second right is to avoid (stirring) his anger, follow his wishes and obey his commands. The third right is to support him with your soul, property, tongue, hands and legs. The fourth right is to be his eyes, his guide and his mirror. The fifth right is that you must not be satisfied with food while he is hungry, with drinks while he is thirsty, and that you dress up in finery while he does not have any clothes. The sixth right is not to allow yourself to have a servant while your brother in belief does not have any servant. It then is necessary to send your servant to wash his clothes, prepare food and his bed for him. The seventh right is to keep his share handsomely, accept his invitations, visit him when he is ill, attend his funeral and if he needs something, initiate to fulfill it and do not delay until he asks you for help.

On seeing those who will be to the right of Allah, the ones below will not feel happy because of the enviable merits of the persons above.’ Ibn abu Ya’fur then asked, ‘How is it that they will not see when they are on the right of Allah?’ The Imam said, ‘O ibn abu Ya’fur, they are veiled with the light of Allah. Are you not aware of the Hadith that the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Allah has a creature on the right of the Throne before Allah and on the right of Allah their faces are whiter than snow and brighter than the sun of the midday. Someone asks, ‘Who are they?’ It will be said, ‘These are the ones who loved each other in the Glory of Allah.’” ",

When death approached the pagan man, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, inspired him, ‘I swear by my Majesty and Glory, had I any place for you in my paradise I would have admitted you therein, but it is forbidden for those who die as pagans.

His sustenance will be provided in both ends of the day.’ I then asked the Imam, ‘(Does it come) from paradise?’ The Imam said, ‘It comes from wherever Allah wishes.’” ",

Do not argue with people about your religion; argumentation causes sickness to the heart.

Convey the greeting of peace to them and tell them, “May Allah grant blessings to those who attract people’s love to himself, speak to them (common people) about what they know and conceal from them what they deny.’” The Imam then said, ‘By Allah, our bitter enemy, is not more of a problem bigger for us than those who speak of us things that we dislike. If you hear a servant (of Allah) publicizing (our cause) then walk to him and turn him away from it. If he did not accept your advice then leave him to one who might prove to be heavier for him and he would listen to him. There are those of you who on request meet the needs of a person with kindness. Be kind to me in my needs as you are kind to each other in your needs. If he accepts from you, that is fine, otherwise, bury his words under your feet and do not say, ‘He says so and so.’ This will make it difficult for you and for me.

Muhammad ibn Ja’far has narrated from Muhammad ibn Isma’il from ‘Abd Allah ibn Dahir from al-Hassan ibn Yahya from Qathm abu Qatadah al-Harrani from ‘Abd Allah ibn Yunus from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “Once a man called Hammam, an assiduous worshipper practicing religious rules and a hardworking man came to Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) during his speech and said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, describe for us the qualities of the believer as if we see him before our eyes.’ “Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) said, ‘O Hammam, a believer is a smart, intelligent one whose delight is on his face and whose sadness is in his heart, his chest is vastly open, his soul is most humble, he criticizes one’s leaning to every mortal, exhorts to go for everything good. He is not hateful, quarrelsome, scandalous, faultfinding or backbiting. He dislikes high positions (of negative nature) and is an enemy of fame and publicity. His sadness remains for a long time, his ambition is far reaching. He very often remains silent, dignified, ever remembering (the Lord), exercising patience, grateful, sad due to his thoughts, happy with his poverty, easy in his nature, kindhearted, of strong loyalty, of very little trouble, not a liar or insulting. “When laughing, he does not burst. When angry he does not msh. His laughing is smiles, his question is to learn, his review is to understand, his knowledge is plentiful, his forbearance is great and his blessing is a great deal. He is not stingy, he does not hasten, irritate or act as an extremist, is not unjust in his judgment, or unfair due to his knowledge. His soul is more solid than a rock, his labor is more sweet than honey. He is not greedy, intolerant, violent, conceited, pretending or exaggerating. He is graceful in disputed matters, of honorable visitation, a man of justice when angry, a friend when asked. He is not adventurous, or insulting and coercive. His love is pure, he is of solid promise, of fulfilling commitment, affectionate, a keeper of good relations, forbearing, calm, of very little that is extraneous, happy with Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, and opposes his own desires. He is not rough toward his inferiors and does not indulge in what is not his business. He is a supporter of religion, a defender of believers, a stronghold for Muslims, and admiration does not affect him negatively, greed does not hurt his heart, playfulness does not change his judgment and ignorant ones cannot find the limits of his knowledge. “His words are many and he is a determined scholar. He is not abusive or furious. He reaches out without harshness, is generous not a spendthrift, is not deceitful or treacherous, is not a faultfinder or unjust to a human being. He is a friend of the creatures, effortful on earth, assistant of the weak and a helper of the helpless. He does not violate what is hidden or uncover secrets, his trials are a great deal and his complaints very little. He remembers the good that he had seen, covers up the evil that he may observe, hides the defects, safeguards the unseen, corrects slips and forgives mistakes. He does not walk away from an advice that he can give, and he does not give up reforming an unjust instance. He is trustworthy, steadfast, pious, clean, purified and consenting. He accepts excuses, speaks of someone with grace and he is good and expects good from people. “He accuses his soul of defects, loves for the sake of Allah with understanding and knowledge, cuts off relations for the sake of Allah with firmness and determination. Happiness does not trespass upon him and intense happiness does not make him excited. He is a reminder for the scholar and a teacher for the ignorant. He is not expected to cause a calamity. He is not feared for causing a tragedy, every effort to him is more sincere than his own and every soul is more correct than his own. He knows his defects. He is busy with his own sadness. He does not trust anyone except his Lord. He feels a stranger, lonely, dispossessed and sad. He loves for the sake of Allah, strives for the sake of Allah to follow His happiness. He does not revenge by himself for his own self. He does not make friends to make his Lord angry. He sits with the poor, is a friend of the truthful ones, a supporter of the people of truth and an assistant for those near to him. He is like a father for the orphans, like a husband for the widows, the first hope for the destitute, expected to remove every resentful matter and to relieve every difficulty. “He is light and happy, is not frowning or sly, is strong, controlling of anger, smiling, sharp-sighted and greatly cautious. He does not ignore, and if ignored, he is forbearing. He is not stingy and if stinginess, is used against him he exercises patience. He understands, thus he is bashful, is content, independent and is self-sufficient. His bashfulness is higher than his lust, his love is higher than his jealousy and his forgiveness is higher than his hate. He does not speak without correctness and does not dress unless it is economical. He walks humbly, is submissive before his Lord in obedience and is happy with Him in all conditions. His intention is pure and sincere. His deeds are free of fraud and deceit. His observations are good lessons, his silence is thoughtful and his words are wisdom. He is advising, charitable and brotherly. He gives good advice in public and in private. He does not abandon his brother, does not backbite him and does not plot against him. He does not regret what he has missed, and does not become sad for whatever befalls him. He does not hope for what is not lawful. He does not fail in hardships and does not perpetrate in comfort. He mixes forbearance with knowledge and reason with patience. He is not lazy but is always active, of very short longing and of very few slips. (Good) is expected through him, his heart is fearful, he always speaks of his Lord, his soul is content, his ignorance is negative, his affairs are easy, he is sad for his sins, his lust is dead, his anger is controlled and his moral behaviors are lucent. “His neighbors live safely with him, his pride is weak, he is content with whatever is determined for him, his patience is strong, his affair is well established and his remembering (the Lord) is a great deal. He meets people to learn and remains silent for safety, he asks questions to understand, and he trades to earn. He does not remain silent for good to be subjected to injustice, and does not speak to be used in doing injustice to others. His soul is tired of him and people are comfortable with him. He has tired his soul for the gains of the next life and has provided comfort to others by means of his soul. If rebellion is committed against him he exercises patience until Allah finds support for him. His distancing when distancing is needed comes in overlooking and in graceful disregard, and his closeness when closeness is needed comes as kindness and blessings. His distancing is not out of boastfulness or greatness and his closeness is not a plot or deceit. It is because he follows the footsteps of those before him, the people of goodness. Thus, he is the leader for those after him. “The narrator has said that Hammam breathed very deeply and fell down unconscious. Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) said, ‘By Allah I was afraid of its effect for him. This is how effective advice works on people deserving such advice. Someone said, ‘Why does it not apply to you, O Amir al-Mu’minin?’ The Imam said, ‘For everything there is an appointed time that is not surpassed and a cause that does not fail. Wait, and do not transgress. It was a blow that Satan made to flow through your tongue.’” ",

Of the qualities of the believing people, O Ali, is their presence in prayer, quick payment of al-Zakat (charity), feeding the destitute, placing of their hand on the heads of the orphans (to comfort them), cleansing of their clothes, and their tying up their waist with covering. They are those who do not lie when speaking, do not disregard their promise, and do not violate their trust. They tell the truth when they speak up, at night they are monks and are lions during the day. During the days they fast and stand up for worship at night. They do not harm the neighbors and the neighbors do not experience any harm from them. They are those who walk on earth in humble manners, and their steps move to the homes of the widows (to help) and in the procession for funerals. May Allah make us of the pious ones.’” ",

The head of what was the greatest in my sight about him was the worthlessness of the world in his sight. He was free of the control of his stomach, thus, he did not have any appetite for what he could not find; he, however, would not accede when he did find it. He was out of the control of his private parts and it would not weigh his reason and opinion lightly. He was out of the control of ignorance, thus, he would not extend his hands unless he was confident of its benefits. He did not desire, become angry, or disappointed. Most of the time he remained silent, and when he spoke, he surpassed the speakers. He did not enter in arguments or take part in claims. He would not testify without the presence of a judge. He was not unaware of his brothers (in belief) and did not appropriate anything for himself without them. He was the weakest of the weak people but in serious matters he acted as an advancing lion. He did not blame anyone without a good cause. He would do what he said, and would not say what he would not do. When he became attracted to two things that he did not know which is better he would ignore that which he desired most. He would not complain for any pain before anyone unless he had known that one had a cure for it and would not consult anyone unless he had hope for good advice from him. He did not become frustrated, angered, and did not complain, desire, revenge and did not remain neglectful of his enemies. Therefore, you must acquire such noble moral behaviors if you can. You must acquire the little if you cannot bear the whole. There is no means and power without Allah.”’ ",

A horseman may run under its shadow for a hundred years and the shadow will not end. A crow (with the longest life span in birds) may fly from its trunk upward but before reaching the top of the tree will drop death due to old age. Therefore, you must develop an interest in this.

He said, ‘O Sadir, were I to have as many Shi’a (followers) as the number of these goats, then it would not have been permissible for me to sit (without proclaiming my leadership).’ We dismounted and prayed. When we finished the prayer 1 turned to the goats and counted them. There were seventeen heads of goats in the flock.’” ",

        "englishText": "16. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from his father in a marfu’ manner from Muhammad ibn Dawud al-Ghanawi from Asbagh ibn Nubatah who has said the following: “Once a man came to Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) and said, ‘O Amir al- Mu’minin, certain people think a servant of Allah, who is a believer, does not fornicate, commit theft, drink wine, consume unlawful interest in trade, and does not spill blood that is not lawful to spill. This has become heavy on me and my chest feels constrained when 1 think that this servant (of Allah) prays the way I do, pleads to Allah the way I do, marries from us and agrees we marry from them, he can inherit us and I can inherit him but is out of belief just because of a few sins. ’ Amir al- Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) said, ‘You spoke the truth. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, and evidence to it is the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘People are of three categories and of three stages as mentioned in the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy: people of the right, people of the left and the foremost people. The foremost people are the Messenger prophets and non-Messenger prophets. In these people Allah has placed five spirits: The Holy Spirit, the spirit of belief, the spirit of power, the spirit of desire and the spirit of the body. With the Holy Spirit they were raised as the prophets who were Messengers and non-Messengers and with this they received the knowledge about things. With the spirit of belief they worshipped Allah and did not consider anything as His partners. With the spirit of power they performed Jihad (hard work in the way of Allah) and managed their living. With the spirit of desire they enjoyed food, lawful carnal relations with young women. With the spirit of the body they were able to move and walk around. These people are forgiven and no sin is recorded against them. Then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘We gave certain ones of Our Messengers preference over others. There are those to whom Allah spoke and He raised the rank of certain others. We gave authoritative proof to Jesus, son of Mary, and supported him by means of the Holy Spirit. . . .’ (2:253) Then about one group He has said, ‘He has supported them with a spirit from Him.’ He (Allah) says that He has given them honor with it and has granted excellence over the others. These are forgiven and no sins are recorded against them.’ “He (the Messenger of Allah) then mentioned the people of the right hand and they are the believers in truth, in reality. Allah has placed four spirits in them: The spirit of belief, the spirit of power, the spirit of desire and the spirit of the body. A servant continues to perfect these four spirits and goes through conditions.’ The man then asked, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, what are these conditions?’ The Imam said, ‘The first condition is as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘Certain individuals among you will grow to an extremely old age and lose their memory. . . .’ (16:70) All the spirits in him reduce and it is not a case wherein he is out of the religion of Allah. It is because the agent has returned him to the weakest point of life. He does not recognize the time for prayer, he is not able to perform Tahajjud (prayer at night) nor is he able to stand up in line with people. It is a reduction in the spirit of belief but it does not harm him. In certain ones of them the spirit of power is reduced; thus, they are not able to fight the enemy or make a living. In others the spirit of desire is reduced and a time comes when the daughters of Adam show no passion for him; he does not stand up. The spirit of the body remains with him. He moves and walks around until the angel of death comes. This condition is good because Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, is the power behind it. He faces other conditions when he is strong and young. He thinks of committing sins and the spirit of power encourages him, the spirit of desire makes it attractive to him and the spirit of the body leads him until he falls in sin. If he faces weakness in belief and it moves away from him it (belief) will not return to him before repentance. If he then repents, Allah turns to him (with forgiveness) but if he repeats the sin, Allah sends him to fire.’ “The people of the left are the Jews and the Christians as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘Those to whom We have given the Book (Bible) know you (Muhammad) just as good as they know their sons.’ They know Muhammad and al- Walayah (the status of people who possess Divine Authority) from the Torah and the Gospel just as they know their sons in their homes. ‘ ... It is clear that certain individuals among them deliberately hide the truth. (2:146) Never doubt that the essence of truth (that you are the Messenger of Allah to them) comes from your Lord.’ (2:147) When they rejected what they knew Allah placed them under the trial. He removed the spirit of belief from them and allowed the three spirits to remain in them: The spirit of power, the spirit of desire and the spirit of the body. Thereafter He added them to the animals saying, ‘They are like cattle or even more, straying and confused.’ (25:44) The animals carry loads because of the spirit of power, feed themselves because of the spirit of desire and move around because of the spirit of the body.’ The man who had asked the question then said, ‘You brought life to my heart by the permission of Allah, O Amir al-Mu’minin, recipient of divine supreme covenant.’” ",

Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) asked, ‘What made you stop reading further?’ He said, T like to know the major sins from the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy.’ The Imam said, ‘O ‘Amr, the biggest of the major sins is to consider things as partners of Allah. Allah says, ‘Whoever considers things as partners of Allah must know that Allah has forbidden their entering into paradise.’ Thereafter is to despair of the mercy of Allah; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘No one despairs from the mercy of Allah except the unbelievers.’ (12:87) Another of the major sins is to feel safe from the punishment of Allah; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, “No one disregards the punishment of Allah except the losing people.” (7:99) Of the major sins is to disregard maintaining good relations with parents; Allah, the Most Glorious, has considered such a person oppressive and hard-hearted. (19:4) Another of the major sins is murdering, for no good reason, a person that Allah has made unlawful to murder; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hell fire forever.’ (4:93) Accusing a married women of committing indecent acts is a major sin; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘They are condemned in this world and in the next life and for them there is a great punishment.’ (24:23) Consuming the property of the orphans as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘They eat fire in their belly and they will feel the heat of a blazing fire.’ (4:10) Running away from the enemy in the battlefield; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘. . . whoever would turn back at that time, except for strategic reasons or to join another band (8:15) will incur the wrath of Allah and will dwell in hell, a terrible dwelling.’ (8:16) Consuming unlawful interest in trade is among the major sins; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘Those who take unlawful interest will stand before Allah (on the Day of Judgment) as those who suffer from a mental imbalance because of Satan’s touch.’ (2:275) Another major sin is performing magic: Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘. . . They knew very well that one who engaged in witchcraft will have no reward in the life hereafter. . . .’ (2:102) Fornication is a major sin; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘. . . those who commit fornication have committed a sin (25:68) and on the Day of Judgment their torment will be double. They will suffer forever in disgrace.’ (25:69) False oath for an unlawful purpose is a major sin; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘Those who sell their covenant with Allah and their promises for a small price will have no share in the life hereafter. . . .’ (3:77) Treachery in dealing with property seized from the enemy in battle; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘A treacherous person will be brought before Allah on the Day of Judgment with his treacherous deeds. . . .’ (3:161) Not to pay al-Zakat, obligatory (charity) is a major sin; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘. . . their treasures will be heated by the fire of hell and pressed against their foreheads, sides and backs. . . .’ (9:35) To present false testimony and to hide a testimony is a major sin; Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, says, ‘Do not refuse to testify to what you bore witness. Whoever does so has committed a sin. . . .’ (2:283) Drinking wine is a major sin; Allah, The Most Majestic, the Most High has prohibited it as He has prohibited the worship of idols and disregarding intentionally to perform prayers or anything that Allah has made obligatory; the messenger of Allah has said, ‘Those who disregard, intentionally, the prayer Allah and His Messenger will have no responsibility toward such people. Disregarding one’s promise and covenant and disregard of maintaining good relations with relatives are among the major sins; Allah, The Most Majestic, the Most High says, ‘These . . . will have Allah’s condemnation and will face the most terrible end.’ (13:25) “The narrator has said that ‘Amr left sobbing and saying, ‘Destroyed is one who speaks of his opinion (in religious issues) and opposes you (Imam) in the matters of excellence and knowledge.’” ",

For this reason most of the things that the children of Adam want do not need them. Thereafter is Envy. It is the sin of the son of Adam who envied his brother and killed him. From this branches love for women, love for the world, love to become the leader, the love to be comfortable, the love to speak, the love to be superior and rich. They total seven characteristics and all are found in the love for the world. The prophets and the scholars after knowing this have said, ‘Love for the world is the head of all sins.’ The world is of two kinds: The world of bare necessities and the condemned one.’” ",

Jesus said, ‘They all have died from violence. Had they died individually they would have buried each other.’ The disciples said, ‘O Spirit of Allah and His word, pray to Allah to bring them to life so we may ask about their deeds and avoid them (bad ones).’ Jesus prayed to his Lord and from space he was told to call them. Jesus at night stood on a high ground that dominated the town and said, ‘O people of the town?’ A certain individual replied, ‘Yes, O the Spirit of Allah and His word.’ He then said, ‘Woe upon you. What kind of deeds did you have?’ He said, ‘We worshipped the devil, loved the world with little fear, had long hopes and neglectfully engaged in useless and playful activities.’ Jesus asked, ‘How was your love of the world?’ He replied, ‘It was like a child’s love for his mother. When it came to us we rejoiced in happiness and when it went away we felt sad and cried.’ He then asked, ‘How was your worship of the devil?’ He replied, ‘It was obedience to the sinful people.’ Jesus asked, ‘How were the consequences of your activities?’ He replied, ‘We spent one night in comfort and in the morning we found ourselves in Hawiyah (a place in hell).’ Jesus asked, ‘What is HawiyahT He said, ‘It is Sijjin ’ Jesus asked, ‘What is SijjinV He said, ‘It is a mountain of burning coal that smolders upon us to the Day of Judgment.’ Jesus asked, ‘What did you say and what was said to you?’ He replied, ‘We said, ‘Return us to the worldly life so we can live piously, and it was said to us, “You are lying.”’ Jesus asked, ‘Why do not the others of you talk to me?’ He said, ‘O Spirit of Allah, they are harnessed with a harness of fire which is in the hands of stern and strong angels. I was among them, but not one of them. When punishment struck it took me with them. I am hanged by a hair on the brink of hell and I do not know if I will be saved or thrown into hell.’ Jesus then turned to the disciples and said, ‘Friends of Allah, eating dried up bread with not so pleasant salt and sleeping on the trash collection sites is much better in good health and safety in this world and in the next life.’” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from Isma’il ibn Mehran from abu Sa’id al-Qammat from Aban ibn Taghlib from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “When the Holy Prophet was taken to visit the heavens, he asked, ‘O Lord, how is the condition of the believers before you?’ He (Allah) said, ‘O Muhammad, whoever insults any of My friends has declared war against Me. I am the quickest to help My friends. I have not hesitated in any of My acts as much as I do at the time of the death of a believer who dislikes death and I dislike to disappoint him. Of My believing servants there are those who do not perform well without wealth and if I change his condition he is destroyed. Also among My believing servants are those who do not perform well unless they are poor and, if I change their condition to something else, they are destroyed. For seeking nearness to Me there is no better means for My servant than to fulfill what 1 have made obligatory for them and that he should seek nearness to Me through performing optional acts of worship so I will love him. When I will love him I will be his ears with which he will hear, his eyes with which he will see, his tongue with which he will speak and his hands with which he will perform his activities. Whenever he prays I will answer him and, whenever he asks a favor, I will grant him.’” ",

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Muhammad ibn Jumhur from Ahmad ibn al-Husayn from his father from Isma’il ibn Muhammad from Muhammad ibn Sinan who has said the following: “Once I was in the presence of al-Rida (a.s.) and he stated to me as follows: ‘O Muhammad, in the time of the children of Israel there were four believing people. One of them once went to the house where the other three had gathered together for a meeting on a certain issue among them. He knocked the door and a slave came to him. He then asked, ‘Where is your master?’ The slave replied, ‘He is not home.’ The man returned back and the slave went inside. His master asked, ‘Who was at the door?’ The slave replied, ‘It was so and so and I told him that you were not home.’ He remained quiet without regretting or blaming the slave for his false reply, nor did the other two show any concern for the return of their friend from the door and they continued talking. Next morning the man (their friend) came to the door very early and met the other three when they were leaving to go to a certain property that belonged to one of them. He offered them his greeting of peace and said, ‘I also want to come with you.’ They agreed but did not apologize to him for their attitude the day before. The man was needy or weak. On a certain part of the way a piece of cloud appeared over their heads with shadows and they thought it might rain. They began to move faster. When the cloud reached exactly over their heads an announcer announced from the cloud, ‘O fire, strike them. I am Jibril (Gabriel), the Messenger of Allah. ’ Suddenly, fire from the cloud snatched the three away and the man remained frightened and astonished for what had happened to the other people. He did not know the reason. He came to the city and met Yusha’ ibn Nun (peace be upon him). He explained to him what he had seen and heard. Yusha’ asked, ‘Did you not know that Allah had become angry with them, after that He was happy with them? It was because of the way they behaved toward you.’ He asked, ‘What had they done to me?’ Yusha’ informed him of their behavior and the man said, ‘I, however, am ready to forgive them.’ Yusha’ said, ‘Had this happened before it could have benefited them but now it does not benefit them and perhaps it may benefit them afterwards.’” ",

Why is it that in the two aforementioned cases it is not ‘considered insignificant’ as is the case with ignoring prayer?

(2) There is disbelief for disregarding the commands of Allah. (3) Another form of disbelief for disavowing, and (4) disbelief in the bounties is still another form of disbelief. “Disbelief for denial is (a) denial of His Lordship and it is the belief of those who say that there is no Lord, paradise and fire. It is the belief of two kinds of atheism, called Dahriah, who say, ‘It is only time that destroys us.’ (45:23) It is a religion that they made for themselves on the basis of what they felt to be good with out proof and research in any of the things they say. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘It is only what they guess, . . .’ (45:23) their religion is based on mere guessing. Allah has said, ‘Those who deny your message will not believe, whether you warn them or not.’ (2:6) They will not believe in the Oneness of Allah. This is one kind of disbelief. (b) The other kind of denial is denial of knowledge. This is when the denying person denies knowing well the truth that is established before him. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘They rejected the evidence because of their arrogance and injustice, although their souls knew it to be true. . . .’ (27:14) Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘. . . despite the fact that they had been praying for victory over the disbelievers (by the help of the truthful Prophet), they refused to accept this book, even though they knew it (to be the Truth). May Allah condemn those who hide the Truth.” (2:89) This is the explanation of two kinds of disbelief.’ “The third kind of disbelief is disbelief in the bounties as Allah, the Most High, has said quoting Sulayman, ‘. . . This is a favor from my Lord by which He wants to test whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever thanks Allah, does so for his own good. Whoever is ungrateful to Allah should know that my Lord is Self-sufficient and Benevolent.’ (27:40) Allah has said, ‘If you give thanks, I shall give you greater (favors), but if you deny the Truth, know that My retribution is severe.’ (14:7) Allah has said, ‘ . . . remember Me and I shall remember you. Thank Me and do not hide the truth about Me.’ (2:152) “The fourth kind of disbelief is disbelief in the form of disregard of what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has commanded as in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘We made a covenant with you that you should not shed each other’s blood or expel each other from your homeland. You accepted and bore witness to this covenant, (2:84) yet you murdered each other and forced a number of your people out of their homeland, helping each other to commit sin and to be hostile to one another. When you had expelled people from their homeland and later they had been made captives (of other people), you then paid their ransom (thinking that it was a righteous deed). Allah forbade you to expel these people in the fust place. Do you believe in one part of the Book and not in the other? [They are called unbelievers due to their disregard of the commands of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, and He has ascribed them to belief but He has not accepted it and it has been of no benefit before Him] and He has said, . Those who behave in this way shall reap disgrace in this world and severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection. Allah is not unaware of things that you do.’ (2:85) “The fifth kind of disbelief is disbelief in the form of disavowing as in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, quoting Ibrahim (Abraham), ‘We have rejected you. Enmity and hatred will separate us forever unless you believe in Allah only. . . .’ (60:4) This is disavowing. Allah has said when mentioning (the case of) Satan and his friend of man on the Day of Judgment, ‘I did not agree with your belief that I was equal to Allah. . . .’ (14:22) Allah has said, ‘. . . you believe in idols besides Allah, only out of worldly love, but on the Day of Judgment you will reject and condemn each other . . .’ (29:25) That is disavowing each other.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Ibrahim ibn ‘Umar al-Yamani from ‘Umar ibn ‘Udhaynah from Aban ibn abu ‘Ayyash from Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali from Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) who has said the following: “Disbelief is established on four pillars: Sinfulness, Extremism, Doubt and Skepticism. Sinfulness has four branches: harshness of manners, blindness of heart, neglect, and arrogance. Whoever behaves in a harsh manner belittles the truth, hates the people of profound understanding and persists in great sins. Whoever becomes blind of heart forgets to remember (the truth), follows guesses, opposes his Creator and Satan turns bold toward him. He asks forgiveness without repenting, feeling humble and without being unaware of sin. Whoever is neglectful and careless commits a crime against his own soul, turns himself upside down and thinks of his misguidance as guidance. Yearnings deceives him, remorse and pangs of guilt seize him and when the matters settle and the curtain is raised, he finds it to be what he did not expect. Whoever is arrogant to obey the commands of Allah doubts and whoever doubts, Allah overpowers him and humiliates him by His Authority and makes him little by His Glory as he has played deceit against his Honorable Lord and has gone to extremes in his affairs. “Extremism is of four branches: Seeking profundity of opinion, disputation over an opinion, looking for deviations in it and creating a schism therein. “Whoever seeks extreme complexity he does not return to the truth, and does not gain anything except sinking in deeper troubles. He does not finish removing one before another trouble overwhelms him. His religion sustains holes and he falls deeper in chaos. Whoever seeks disputation in an opinion and quarrels, his absurdity comes in the open due to prolonged controversy. Whoever deviates, goodness seems terrible to him and evil begins to look lovelier. “Whoever creates a schism, his paths lead to dead end, his affairs burden him, his escape narrows if he would not follow the path of the believers. “Doubt is of four branches: Suspicion, desire, hesitation and submission. It is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘About which of the bounties of your Lord can they persistently dispute and cast doubts?’ (53:55) “In another Hadith it is said, ‘It branches in suspicion, fear of truth, hesitation and submission before ignorance and ignorant people.’ “Whoever fears what is before him turns back. Whoever is suspicious of religion remains hesitant in doubts and the foremost believing people move forward before him and those behind catch up with him. He turns out to be flattened under the hooves of Satan. Whoever submits to worldly destruction and that of the next life is destroyed between the two. Whoever is saved from such condition is due to the excellence of certainty. Allah has not created any creature fewer than certainty. “Casting doubt is of four branches: a liking of attractiveness, stimulation of soul, interpretation of crookedness and mixing of truth with falsehood. “This is because attractiveness clashes with evidence, stimulation of soul indulges in desires and crookedness bends its companion a great bent. Hiding and mixing truth with falsehood is darkness upon darkness. That is disbelief, its pillars and branches.’” ",

Whoever behaves disproportionately faces great risks, remains lonely and without supporters. Whoever transgresses does not remain immune to harmful consequences, his heart is not in peace and he does not control his soul against lustful matters. Whoever has not balanced his soul in lustful matters he indulges in filthy activities. Whoever acts insubordinately purposely and without evidence strays in falsehood. “Neglect is of four branches: dishonesty, yearning, fear and procrastination. Fear and apprehension turns one away from the truth and procrastination leads to extremely reduced activities until the deadline approaches. If one does not have any yearnings he knows his true condition and measures. If he knows the true measure of his condition in which he is, he would die suddenly due to fear and apprehension. Dishonesty cuts short one’s deeds. “Resentment is of four branches: arrogance, boastfulness, egoistic, and racism. Whoever is arrogant turns his back to the truth. Whoever is boastful indulges in sins. Whoever is egoistic persists in sins. Whoever comes in the clench of racism commits injustice. “Thus, evil is the affair that swings in deterioration, indecency, persistence and injustice on the path. “Greed is of four branches: exhilaration, pleasure seeking, worrying and superfluity. Exhilaration is detestable before Allah. Pleasure seeking is feeblemindedness. Worrisome is a misfortune for one who is forced to carry sins. Seeking superfluity is useless, a childish manner, a vastful preoccupation and an effort to change what is of a lower quality to a better one. “This is how hypocrisy its pillars and branches are. Allah is dominant over his servants. Speaking of Him is exalted and glory is His. He has created all things in good fashion. His hands are free, His favor is universal. His command is manifest, His light shines, His blessing overflows. His wisdom is the source of light. His book is overriding. His evidence is overwhelming. His religion is pure. His kingdom is powerful. His word is the truth, His measures are just and His messengers have already preached. Thus, He has made evil a sin, sin a misfortune and misfortune a filth. “He has made virtuous deeds a threshold. The threshold is repentance and repentance is purification. One who repents finds guidance. One who plots goes astray, as long as he does not repent before Allah and confess to his sins. No one dares to act, to his own destruction, against Allah, except those who are doomed. “Allah! Allah! How vast is what He has for repentance, favors, joy and great forbearance. How severe is what is before Him of retribution, hell, and a hard grip! Whoever succeeds in obedience to Him attracts His generosity. Whoever indulges in disobedience to Him he will test the results of His disapproval and very shortly he will become regretful.’” ",

They change to disbelief and denial. May Allah condemn them all.’” ",

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Yunus from a man from Zurara who has said the following: “Once I asked abu Ja’far (a.s.) ‘What do you say about marriage of the people. I have reached this age as you can see and I am not married yet.’ The Imam asked, ‘What prevents you from becoming married?’ I said, ‘What prevents me is fear that it may not be lawful to marry from them. What is your instruction?’ The Imam asked, ‘How can you live and you are young, can you exercise patience?’ I said, ‘I can buy slaves.’ The Imam asked, ‘Here you are, how, can slaves be lawful?’ I said, ‘A slave is not like a free person. If something may make me suspicious I can sell her and stay away from her.’ The Imam said, ‘Tell me how you make her lawful.’ I (the narrator) had no answers. “1 then asked him, ‘What do you say if I married?’ The Imam said, ‘I do not mind if you marry.’ I said, ‘Consider your words, ‘I do not mind if you did,’ it has two aspects: I do not mind if you sinned without my command. What is your command? Should I do it by your command?’ The Imam said, ‘The Messenger of Allah had married. There are the cases of the wives of Noah and Lot as they were in wedlock with two virtuous servants (of Allah).’ I said, ‘The Messenger of Allah is not of the same position as I. She was under his control and acknowledged his judgment and his religion. ’ The Imam asked, ‘What do you think of unfaithfulness in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘They both were unfaithful to the two of them.’ (66:9) He does not mean thereby anything other than indecent acts. The Messenger of Allah had married so and so.’ “I then said, ‘May Allah keep you well, what do you command me? Should I go and marry by your command?’ The Imam said to me, ‘Were you to marry, you should marry al-BuIaha’ of women.’ I asked, ‘Who are al-Bulaha’ of women?’ The Imam said, ‘Those who observe Hijab and are chaste.’ I asked, ‘How is she who is in the religion of Salim ibn abu Hafsah?’ The Imam said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘How is she that is in the religion of Rabi’ah al-Ra’i?’ The Imam said, ‘No, but marry those who are under the guardianship of their fathers, who are not unbelievers and do not know what you believe in.’ I asked, ‘Is it not the case that she is either a believer or an unbeliever?’ The Imam said, ‘One who fasts, performs prayer, is pious before Allah and does not know what is your cause.’ I said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said, ‘It is He Who has created you. Among you there are believer and unbelievers,’ (64:2) no, by Allah, there is no one in the people who is not a believer or an unbeliever.’ “The narrator has said that abu Ja’far (a.s.) then said, ‘The words of Allah are truer than your words, O Zurara. Have you not considered the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘ . . . they have mixed virtuous deeds with sinful ones. Perhaps Allah will forgive them. Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.’ (9:102) Why has Allah said, “perhaps”?’ I said, ‘They are either believing people or unbelievers.’ “The narrator has said that the Imam then asked, ‘What do you think of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘As for the really weak and oppressed men, women, and children who were not able to find any means of obtaining their freedom or of having the right guidance, . . . ’ (4:98) guidance to belief?’ I said, ‘They are either believers or unbelievers. ’ The Imam said, ‘By Allah they are not believing people nor unbelievers.’ Then the Imam turned to me and asked, ‘What do you think of the people of ‘A’raf?’ I said, ‘They are none other than either believers or unbelievers. If they enter paradise they are believers and if they go in the fire, they are unbelievers.’ The Imam said, ‘By Allah, they are not believers nor are they unbelievers. Were they believers they would have entered paradise like the other believing people. Were they unbelievers they would have gone in the fire like the other unbelievers. In fact, they are people whose good and bad deeds were equal. They had shortages of deeds. They will be as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has said.’ I asked, ‘Are they of the people of paradise or of the people of the fire?’ The Imam said, ‘Leave them alone as Allah has done.’ I asked, ‘Do you leave their affairs in postponement?’ The Imam said, ‘Yes, I do as Allah has done. If Allah wills He will send them to paradise through his favor, and if He wills He will drive them to the fire for their sins without being unjust to them.’ I said, ‘Will unbelievers go to paradise?’ The Imam said, ‘No.’ I asked, ‘Will anyone other than unbelievers go in the fire?’ “The narrator has said that the Imam said, ‘No, except what Allah will wish. O Zurara, I say, ‘What Allah wills and you do not say what Allah wills. When you will grow up you will turn around and your knots ease up (on your opponents).”’ Note: The above Hadith is very critical of the attitude of Zurara, according to commentators. In his defense, due to his prominent position in view of the scholars, it is said that either at that time he was very young or later he matured. He believed those who did not, would not and could not believe in the Divine Authority of ‘A ’immah could never go to paradise. Also, it is said that perhaps the whole Hadith due to weakness in the chain of narrators is not reliable. Zurara seems unable to find any room in his heart for those who did not respect Ahl al- Bayt (a.s.) properly. ",

He (Allah) makes him know His Holy Prophet, then he professes to obey him and He makes him know His Imam, His Authority on His earth and His witness over His creatures, then he professes to obey him. ’ “I then asked, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, does this hold true even if one is ignorant of all other things besides what you just mentioned?’ The Imam said, ‘Yes, if he when commanded obeys and when prohibited upholds it. The least of that with which a servant (of Allah) becomes an unbeliever is that when upon a mere guess one says that this is what Allah has commanded and this is what Allah has prohibited. Then he assigns it to be his religion upon which he bases his system of guardianship (religious authority). He guesses that he obeys the one who has commanded him to do it and, in fact, he worships Satan only.’ “The least of that with which a servant (of Allah) is considered straying is when he does not know the Authority of Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, His witness over His servants. The Authority about whom Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has commanded His servants to obey and has made it obligatory to love him as one’s Divine Guardian.’ I then said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, describe them (the people who possess Divine Authority) for me.’ The Imam said, ‘They are those whom Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has mentioned along with His Ownself and His Holy Prophet saying, ‘Believers, obey Allah, His Messenger, and your leaders (people who possess Divine Authority). . . .’ (4:59) I said, ‘O Amir al- Mu’minin, May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, explain it to me.’ The Imam said, ‘They (people who possess Divine Authority) are those about whom the Messenger of Allah in his last sermon on the day that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, took him (from this world) said, ‘I leave among you behind me two matters. If you will hold firmly to these two you will never stray: the book of Allah and my descendents, my family. The Most Subtle and Most Expert, (Allah) has informed me that these two will never separate from each other until they will arrive before me at the pond in paradise like this - he joined his index finger and thumb - not like this - he joined his middle finger and thumb so that one may proceed before the other. You must hold firmly to these two, you will not slip, or stray and do not go before them; you will stray.’” ",

I then see what is best for him in his next life. I then like to speed up punishment for him in this world to get even for that sin. I determine the punishment for that sin and make a decision about it. I then keep it on hold without executing and, in its execution I have a wish, and My servant does not know about it. 1 then hesitate many times in its execution. I then keep it on hold and do not execute; I dislike making him suffer and avoid sending affliction upon him. I then grant him forgiveness and ignore (his sin) because of love for his offsetting the sin through his many optional prayers at nights, as well as during the day, with which he tries to get closer to Me. I then divert the misfortune from him even though I had already determined, decided and had kept it on hold and for its execution I had a wish. I then write for him a great reward for the ‘Would be coming misfortune’ upon him. I preserve it for him, make his reward available and he does not realize it. No trouble or misfortune reaches him. I am Allah, the Honorable, the Compassionate, the Merciful.’” ",

There is the day that you are waiting for and you are not sure if you will avoid acting extremely (bad) in it.

Allah has said, ‘‘The virtuous ones will live in bounties and the evil doers will live in fire.” (82:14,15) The man than asked, ‘Where then is the mercy of Allah?’ He replied, ‘The mercy of Allah is very close to the people who do good deeds.’ “Abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) then said, ‘A man wrote to abu Dhar, may Allah be pleased with him, “O abu Dhar instruct me with a few things of knowledge.” He wrote back to him, ‘Knowledge is of many kinds, however, if you are able not to disappoint those whom you love, then do so. Yes, your soul is the most beloved to you. When you disobey Allah, you are doing bad and disappointing things to your own soul.’” ",

Whoever obeys Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, in whatever He has commanded and then prays to Him the way prayer should be done He answers them.’ I then asked, ‘What is the way of prayer?’ The Imam said, ‘Begin the prayer by praising Allah, recall His bounties with you, thank Him, ask favors from Him for the Holy Prophet, recall your sins and confess them then seek refuge against them and such is the way of praying.’ Then the Imam said, ‘What is the other verse?’ I said, ‘It is the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘. . .He will replace whatever you spend for His cause and He is the best provider of sustanance,’ (34:39) I spend but do not see any replacement.’ The Imam said, ‘Do you think Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has ignored His promise?’ I said, ‘No.’ The Imam asked, ‘Why is that then?’ I said, ‘I do not know.’ The Imam said, ‘If anyone of you earns something in lawful ways and spends it in a lawful way, every dirham (unit of money) is replaced.’” ",

Do not allow him to find a way in you to despair you. Abu Ja’far (a.s.) would say, “A believing person prays and pleads before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, for help and help is delayed due to love for his voice and listening to his intense weeping.’” The Imam then said, ‘By Allah, whatever Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, delays for believing people of the help that they may ask in this world is far better for them than helping them quickly. Such a worthless world! Abu Ja’far (a.s.) would say, ‘It is very proper for a believing person to pray for help in his comfort just like in hardships. He should not grow to be lazy after receiving help to lose interest in prayer.’ You should never lose interest in prayer; it is of a very important position before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy. You should exercise patience and seek to find lawful sustenance, maintain good relations with relatives and should never make it public. We are a family who maintains good relations with those who cut off from us and do favors to those who cause us trouble. In this we find good consequences. If an affluent person in this world prays and asks for favors, his prayer receives acceptance. He may ask for more and the bounties seem insignificant to him. He does not feel satisfied with anything. When bounties are plentiful a Muslim is in a danger of violating the rights he owes and the mischief that may threaten him. Tell me about yourself. If I will say something to you, will you trust me?’ I (the narrator) said, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, if I do not trust you, then whom will I trust? You possess authority from Allah over His creatures.’ The Imam said, ‘Your trust in Allah must be stronger; you have a covenant with Allah. Has Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, not said, “(Muhammad), if any of My servants ask you about Me, tell them that the Lord says, ‘I am near; I accept the prayers of those who pray.’ Allow My servants answer My call and believe in Me so that perhaps they may know the right direction.’ (2:186) ‘Do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is All-Forgiving and All-Merciful.’ (39:53) ‘Allah promises you forgiveness and favors. Allah is Munificent and All-Knowing.’ (2:268) You must trust Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, more firmly than others. Do not allow anything to find a way in you except good; you are forgiven.’” ",

A number of our people have narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Ash’ari from ibn al-Qaddah from abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) who has said the following: “Everything has a limit where it ends except speaking of Allah which has no limit to end. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has sanctioned obligations. When one fulfills them, their limit is where they end. The limit for the month of Ramadan is that when one fasts that is its limit where it ends, and the limit of Hajj is that when one performs Hajj it ends. Al-Dikr (speaking of Allah) is as such that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, does not agree with a very little of it and He has not set a limit for where it ends.’ The Imam then read this verse of the Holy Quran: ‘Believers, remember Allah very often (33:41) and glorify Him both in the mornings and in the evenings.’ (33:42) “The Imam said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, has not set a limit for it where it would end.’ He them said, ‘My father would speak of Allah very often. I would walk with him and he would speak of Allah. At the time I ate food with him he would speak of Allah. Even when speaking to people it would not stop him from speaking of Allah. I could see his tongue move saying, ‘No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah.’ He would gather all of us together and order us to speak of Allah until sunrise. He would command those of us who could read, to read the Holy Quran and those who could not to speak of Allah. The house in which the Holy Quran is read and Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, is spoken of therein blessings increase and angels are present, the devils run away and it shines to the people of heavens just as a diamond (shaped) star shines for the people of earth. The house in which the Holy Quran is not read, Allah is not spoken of therein, blessings in it decrease, angels move away from it and devils turn to be present therein. The Messenger of Allah once asked, ‘Should I tell you about the best of your deeds, which raise your position the highest and the purest before your owner, much better for you than the world and its money and is better for you than your fighting against your enemies whom you would eliminate or else they would kill you?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He then said, ‘Speak of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, very often.’ “The Imam then said, ‘Once a man came to the Holy Prophet and said, “Who is the best of the people in this Mosque?” He said, ‘The one who speaks of Allah more than others.’ The Messenger of Allah has said, ‘Whoever is given a tongue that speaks of Allah very often has been granted the good for both this and the next life.’ “About the words of Allah, ‘. . . and do not think that by doing such deeds, you have done a great favor to Allah,’ (74:6) the Imam said, ‘It means do not think what you have done for the sake of Allah is a great deal.’” ",

You are blessed and high, glory belongs to You, Lord of the House, accept my prayer. And the means through which I sought nearness to You, increase them for me several times and much more.

A number of our people have narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from certain individuals of his people from Muhammad ibn al-Faraj who has said the following: “Once abu Ja’far ibn al-Rida (a.s.) wrote to me and instructed me with this supplication saying, ‘Whoever recites it after the morning prayer, his wish will come true with ease and Allah will suffice him: “(I begin) in the name of Allah and with Allah. O Lord, grant al-Salat (favors) upon Muhammad and his family. I plead before Allah to keep my affairs in trust with Him, Allah knows well (His) servants. ‘Allah protected him (the believer among the people of Pharoah) against the evil of what they had planned against him. . . .’(40:44,45) ‘No one deserves to be worshipped except You, You are free of all defects. I have been unjust to myself.’ (21:87) ‘We answered his prayer and saved him from sorrow and thus. We save the believing people. ’(21:88) ‘. . . Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best representative.’ (3:173) ‘They returned with the bounties of Allah and additional favors without being touched by evil. . . .’ (3:174), it is as Allah wills, there are no means and no power without Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. “It is as Allah wills, not as people will. It is as Allah wills even though people may dislike it. Sufficient for me is the Lord instead of those cherished, sufficient for me is the Creator instead of the creatures, sufficient for me is the provider of sustenance instead of the recipients of sustenance, the One Who has always been sufficient for me from the time I existed, sufficient for me is Allah besides Whom no one deserves to be worshipped, before Him I place my trust and He is the Lord of the great Throne.’ “The Imam said, ‘When you complete an obligatory prayer say, ‘I have accepted the fact that Allah is my Lord, Muhammad is the Holy Prophet, Islam is the religion, the Holy Quran is the Book and so and so . . . (mention your ‘ A’immah ) are my ‘A’immah. O Lord, protect Your friend, (whom You have granted Divine Authority) so and so . . . (mention the twelfth Imam) from all directions, front, back, right, left, above and below, grant him a long life and make him the one who will rise with Divine Authority to support Your religion, show him what he loves and is the delight to his eyes, in his own person, his descendents, his family, belongings, his followers and his enemies. Show them (his enemies) what frightens them and show him in them what he loves and be the delight to his eyes, grant the cure for our suffering chests (hearts) and the chests of the believing people.’ “The Imam said, ‘The Holy Prophet after completing a prayer would say, “O Lord, forgive me for what I have done and what I will do, what I have hidden, and what I have done in public and forgive my excesses against my own self and that about which You know better than I do. O Lord You are the One Who can move things forward or backwards with Your knowledge of the unseen and through Your power over all creatures. I pray to grant me life as long as it is in my best interest and cause me to die when it is in my best intrest. I plead before You to grant me a sense of concern about You in private and in public, to say the words of the truth in anger or happiness and to economize in poverty and in wealth. I plead before You for bounties that will not vanish and such delight of the eyes that will not discontinue. I plead before You to make me be happy with (Your) determination, with the blessing of death after life, the comfort of life after death, the pleasure of the look at Your face (things that lead to You), the excitement of seeing You, meeting You without being harmed or suffer harmfulness or the misfortune of straying. O Lord, beautify us with the beauty of belief and help us to be guided guides. O Lord, grant us guidance in the matters of those whom You have guided. O Lord, I plead before You for determination in understanding, steadfastness in the affairs, and good understanding. I plead before You for the opportunity to thank You for Your bounties, Your granting good health and yielding to Your right. I plead before You O Lord, to grant me a peaceful heart, and a truthful tongue. I beg You for forgiveness for that which You know. I seek protection with You against the evil of that which You know; You know and we do not know. You have the knowledge of the unseen.’” ",

In the last Sajdah (prostration) of the first two Rak’at say, ‘O the Most High, O the Most Great, O the Beneficent, O the Merciful, O the Hearer of the pleas for help, O the Conferrer of the good, grant al-Salat (favors) upon Muhammad and his family, facilitate for me of the good of this and the next world that much which You would deem proper, divert away from me the evil of this and the next world that much that You deem proper and relieve me from this pain; - mention it by its name - it has caused me anguish and sadness,’ and be persistent in your pleading and prayer.’ “The narrator has said that before his reaching al-Kufa Allah had totally relieved him from that disease.’” (See also Hadith 30 Ch. 103) ",

O Lord, make me love meeting You, and such meeting to be good, mercy, and full of blessings, join me with the virtuous and do not leave me behind with the wicked ones. Join me with the virtuous of the past and those to come, lead me on the path of virtuous ones, assist me against my soul by that with which You assist the virtuous ones against their souls, do not turn me in the evil from which You want to rescue me, O Lord of the worlds.

Free my heart from showing off, desire for popularity, and doubt in Your religion. “O Lord, give me victory in Your religion, energy to worship, understanding of Your creatures, support me twice with Your kindness (in this life and hereafter), brighten my face with Your light, make me interested in what is with You, cause me to die in Your way and in Your religion, the religion of Your Messenger. “O Lord, I seek protection against laziness, old age, cowardice, stinginess, carelessness, hardheartedness, weakness, and destitution. I seek protection with You, O Lord against a soul that does not become satisfied, the heart that does not become humble, the supplication that is not heard, and the prayer (formal) that does not yield any benefit. I seek protection with You for myself, my family, and my children against condemned Satan. “O Lord, no one can protect me against Y ou, I do not find any place to hide from You, do not humiliate me and do not throw me in perdition and in torment. I plead before You to keep me to remain steadfast in Your religion, affirm Your book, and follow Y our messenger. “O Lord, speak of me with Your mercy and do not speak of me with my sins, accept from me (my good deeds), increase for me from Your generosity; I am interested toward You. O Lord, make my reward for speaking and sitting to be Your happiness with me, make my deeds and supplication purely for You, make my reward paradise through Y our mercy, place me together with all I pleaded for before You and increase for me through Your favor; I am greatly interested toward You.

Those who believe in His Oneness have achieved purity, those who worship Him have found guidance, those who obey Him have triumphed and those who have sought His protection have found security. O Lord, O possessor of generosity and glory, beautiful praise and thanks, I plead before You like one who has humbled himself before You with his neck, rubbed his nose on the ground before You, as well as his face, humiliated his soul before You, whose tears have flooded for fear from You, and have continued flowing, who has confessed to his sins before You, his blunders have disgraced him before You, his crimes have made him shunned in Your presence, his power has weakened before You, his resources have diminished, his means of trickery are cut off, all falsehood has disappeared from him, his sins have forced him to lowly positions before You, and to humble himself before You, and to beg You for help. I plead before You like the plea of one who is more desirous in pleading before You than the one pleading as above, who prays before You like him and begs for help more intensely than him. “O Lord, favor the destitution of my expression, humility of my position, my seat and humility before You with my neck. O Lord, I plead before You for guidance against straying, understanding against blindness and intelligence against transgression. O Lord, I plead before You to help me praise You the most in comfort, bear beautiful patience in hardships, the best thanks to You whenever it is the occasion to thank and submission in the doubtful conditions. I plead before You for power to obey You, weakness in disobedience, for the ability to flee to You from You, and to seek nearness to You, so that, O Lord, I seek Your happiness, give preference to doing what makes You happy with me even though it may anger the people, while I seek Your satisfaction. “O Lord, who can I hope if You do not have kindness for me, or who cares for me if You keep me far away, or whose forgiveness benefits me, if You punish me, or whose gifts should I hope for if You deprive me of Your gifts, or who can have honor for me in his hands if You degrade me, whose degrading of me can harm me if You honor me. “O Lord, how bad are my deeds, how obnoxious are my acts, how brutal is my heart, how lengthy are my (worldly) yearnings, how short is my life that has made it so daring to disobey my creator! “O Lord, how good is Your trial for me, how manifest are Your bounties upon me! Your bounties upon me have become so much that I cannot even count them. My thanks to You for the preferences that You have given to me, in the joy for the bounties, is so little that 1 have subjected myself to punishment. I have forgotten speaking of You, have indulged in ignorance after knowledge, crossed over from justice to transgression, from virtuous deeds to sin and to fleeing for fear and sorrow. How small and little are my virtuous deeds compared to my numerous sins, how many and great are my sins compared to the small size of my structure, and weak limbs! “O Lord, how lengthy are my (worldly) hopes in my short life, how short is my life in my lengthy hopes, how hideous is my inside and my outside! O Lord, I have no ground if argued, no excuse to find excuses, no gratitude if I would be tried or if I am favored unless You assist me to be grateful for the favor You have done to me. “O Lord, how light will be my balance tomorrow if You will not make it weigh heavy! How reckless is my tongue if You do not keep it in place! How black is my face if You do not whiten it! O Lord, how would I deal with my sins of the past that have crushed my limbs! O Lord, how can I seek worldly desires and weep for failing to achieve them but do not weep while my regrets for disobedience have intensified and my transgression has gone to the extremities! O Lord, the worldly motives prompted me and I quickly responded, and relied upon them willingly. The motives for the gains of the hereafter prompted me but I lingered and delayed to respond and to move faster to them like the fast moving to the worldly motives, its worthless vanities, smashed up beyond use materials and its fast disappearing mirage. “O Lord, You have frightened and encouraged me and have argued against me to prove me a slave and have sufficed me in my sustenance, but I felt secure from Your warning and lagged behind in acting upon Your encouragement, did not trust Your guarantee, and took Your argument lightly. “O Lord, change my feeling of security from Your warning in this world into fear, my procrastination into zeal and zest and my taking Your argumentation against me lightly into serious concern and anxiety and then make me to be happy with the share of sustenance that You have assigned for me, O Magnanimous, O Magnanimous, I plead before You through Your great name so You be happy (with me) when You are angry, I beg for relief in pain and suffering, light in darkness, and understanding in the confusion of tribulation. “O Lord, make my shield against sins formidable, my position in paradise high, my deeds all accepted, my virtuous deeds to come in multiples and pure. I seek protection with You against all misfortune, the apparent and hidden, against overeating and overdrinking, against the evil of what I know and that which I do not know. I seek protection with You against my buying ignorance at the cost of knowledge, harshness at the cost of forbearing, injustice at the cost of justice, cutting off good relations with relatives at the cost of maintaining good relations with relatives, intolerance at the cost of exercising patience, straying at the cost of guidance and disbelief at the cost of belief.”’ Ibn Mahbub has narrated from Jamil ibn Salih that he has narrated that Ali ibn Salih had a similar supplication and at the end he has added, “Amin, O Lord, of the worlds.” ",

It now is all up to You what You will do to me in Your magnanimity and with my confessing my sins before You for Your majesty and my begging respectfully, I plead before You to deal with me the way it is worthy of You not according to what I deserve.’”",

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from al-‘Abbas from h n Fadl ibn Shadhan ‘Abd al-Rahman from Sufyan al-Hariri from his father from Sa’d al-Khaffaf from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “O Sa’d, learn the Holy Quran; on the Day of Judgment the Holy Quran will come in the best form that people may have ever seen. People will be present in one hundred thousand and twenty rows: the followers of Prophet Muhammad will form eighty thousand rows. The other forty thousand rows will consist of the followers of the other prophets. The Holy Quran will come to the rows of the Muslims in the form of a well-shaped man, offer them the greeting of peace and they look to him and say to each other, ‘No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, the forbearing the magnanimous, this man is one of the Muslims whom we know from his picture and qualities, however, he has been striving about the Holy Quran much harder than we, thus, he has been given this beauty, grace and light which we have not received. “He (the Quran in the form of a person) passes toward the row of the martyrs who look at him and say, ‘No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, the Lord, the Merciful. We know from the signs and qualities he is a martyr, however, he has been of the martyrs at sea, thus, he has received this beauty and grace that is not given to us.’ The Imam said, ‘Then it will pass toward the martyr at sea and the martyrs at sea look at him with astonishment and say, “He is of the martyrs at sea; we know him from his signs and qualities, however, on the island where he suffered must have been much more dangerous than the island where we suffered, thus, he has received this beauty, grace and light.’ “Then he approaches the rows of the prophets and messengers in the form of a messenger prophet. The prophets and messengers look at him and their astonishment increase. They will say, ‘No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah, the Most Forbearing, the Magnanimous, this is a messenger prophet; we know him from his picture and qualities, however, he has been much more virtuous.’ The Imam said, ‘They will come to the Messenger of Allah and ask him, “O Muhammad, who is this?” He then will ask, ‘Do you not know him?’ They will say, ‘We do not know him, however, Allah has not been angry with him.’ The Messenger of Allah will say to them, ‘This is the authority of Allah over His creatures. He offers them greeting of peace and passes thereby to the rows of the angels in the form of a special angel. The angels will look at him and their astonishment increases, his status will seem very great to them. They will say our Lord is Most High, Most Holy. This servant is of the angels. We know him from his picture and qualities, however, he has been more close and special to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, thus, he is dressed up with this much light and beauty that we have not received.’ Then he will come before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Blessed, the Most High, and will bow down below the Throne. “Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High, will speak to the Holy Quran saying, ‘My true spoken words and authority on earth, look up and ask for your wishes. Your wishes shall be granted and your intercession shall be accepted. How did you find my servants?’ “The Holy Quran will then say, ‘My Lord, certain ones among them kept me safely protected and did not lose anything from me but others among them lost me and disrespected me and called me lies even though I was Your authority to all of Your creatures.’ Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, then will say, ‘I swear by My Majesty, Greatness and Highness that I shall give the best reward on this day because of you and shall punish severely because of you.’ “The Imam then continued saying, ‘The Holy Quran will raise his head in another shape.’ I (the narrator) asked the Imam, ‘O abu Ja’far in what shape it will return?’ The Imam said, ‘It will come in the shape of a changed man, slim and tired looking. People in the gathering will see him. Then he will come forward to one of our followers who knew it and would argue with it against the people, opposed to ‘A’immah. The Holy Quran will ask him, ‘Do you know me’? The man will look it (the Holy Quran) and say, ‘O servant of Allah, I do not know you.’ The Holy Quran then will return in his former shape with which it existed among people, and will ask, ‘Do you still not know me’? He will say, ‘Yes, I do know you.’ It will say, ‘I am the Holy Quran for which you kept the whole night awake and faced suffering in your life, hearing disappointing words from people when you spoke from me. Obviously every merchant enjoys the benefit of his trade. Today I am behind you with full support. The Holy Quran will then proceed with him to the Throne of the Lord of Majesty, the Most Blessed, the Most High, and the Quran then will say, ‘Lord, this servant of You was very close to me and very careful about me. He would love others because of me and hate others just because of me.’ “Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, will then say, ‘Allow my servant enter paradise and allow him be dressed and crowned and then let him come back to see his friend, the Quran.’ When that servant of Allah will be well rewarded he will then come back to see his friend the Holy Quran, Allah, the Most High will ask the Holy Quran, ‘Are you happy with Our rewards given to your friend?’ the Holy Quran will say, ‘Lord, I consider it is not enough and I request that he should receive more of all the good things. Allah then will say, ‘I swear by My Majesty, Honor and Highness, I shall reward him and others like him with five things and more: I shall give them eternal youth, good health free from illness, wealth free from poverty, happiness free from sadness and life free from death.’ “The Imam then read this verse: ‘They will not experience any death other than that which they have already been through.’ ( 44 : 56 ) “I (the narrator) then said to abu Ja’far (a.s.) ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, does the Holy Quran speak?’ The Imam smiled and said, ‘May Allah grant favors upon our weak Shi’a (followers), they are people of submission.’ Then he said, ‘Yes, O Sa’D, prayer speaks. It has a form and shape. It commands and prohibits.’ Sa’D then said, ‘It changed my color and I said, “I will not be able to speak of this among people.” Abu Ja’far (a.s.) said, ‘Are people anything else besides our Shi’a (followers)? Those who do not know the right of the prayer, they have denied our rights.’ The Imam then said, ‘O Sa’d do you want, I will make you hear the words of the Holy Quran?’ I said, ‘Yes, may Allah grant you favors.’ The Imam said, ‘Prayer prohibits indecency and unlawful matters and speaking of Allah is greater,’ “prohibition” is speaking, (stopping people from going to) “indecency and unlawful matters” (that) are (nothing else but certain) men. We are the Dhikr of Allah, speaking of Allah, and we are greater.’” (The Holy Quran prohibits people from following certain people called indecency and unlawful matters) ",

Prepare the means for a long journey.’ The Imam said, ‘Miqdad ibn Aswad then stood up and asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what is the ‘peace time’?” The Messenger of Allah said, “It is the time to complete (the task) and cut off (from this world). When mischief confuses you like a dark night you must hold to the Holy Quran; it is an intercessor (an associate whose association is beneficial) whose intercession will be accepted and a solicitor whose words are believed. Whoever gives it the lead it will take him to paradise. Whoever leaves it behind (it) will then drive him to the fire. It is a guide that shows the best path. It is the book that contains details and explanations, and accomplishments. It is a criterion and not a useless thing. It has face and hidden meanings. Its face meaning is law and its hidden meaning is knowledge. Its face meaning is unique and its hidden meaning is deep. It has stars and upon its stars there are stars. Its wonders do not end and its rare facts do not become old. In it there is the torch of guidance, and the lighthouses of wisdom. It serves as proof of veracity of knowledge (for one who wants to verfy the truth of his Knowledge) and who has come to know the attribute, permit him brighten his eyes to reach the attribute. It saves from destruction, and protects against danger. Thinking is life for the heart of an intelligent person, just as in darkness one finds the way with help from light. Thus, your freedom (from worldly attractions) must be the best and your delays the shortest.’” ",

I will be questioned about the preaching of the message and you will be questioned about your responsibility toward the book of Allah and my Sunnah (the laws).”’ ",

The man said, ‘Yes, I do so.’ The Imam asked, ‘Why would you do so?’ The man said, ‘So that I can read Chapter 1 12 of the Holy Quran.’ The Imam (a.s.) remained calm for a while and after an hour said, ‘O Hafs, if any of our Shi’a (followers) do not do good in reading the Holy Quran, in his grave he will receive instruction to read so that Allah will raise him with his proper status; the positions and degrees in paradise are proportionate to the verses of the Holy Quran. One will be told to read and climb. He then reads and climbs up.’ Hafs has said, ‘I never saw anyone more afraid for himself than Musa ibn Ja’far (a.s.) or more hopeful in all people. His reading was full of sadness. When reading the Holy Quran he seemed like addressing (speaking to) a human being.’” ",

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from ‘Abd Allah ibn Ja’far from al-Sayyari from Muhammad ibn Bakr from abu al-Jarud from al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah from Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) who has said the following: “I swear by the One who sent Muhammad (a.s.) with the truth and honored his family, all supplications for protection is in the Holy Quran. In the Holy Quran there is protection against fire, theft, straying of animals from the owner, lost items, or runaway persons. Whoever wants to know, ask me. The narrator has said that a man then stood up and said, ‘Instruct me in something against fire and drowning’ The Imam said, ‘Read this verse: “The (true) Guardian is certainly Allah Who has revealed the Book and is the Guardian of the righteous ones.” (7:196) and ‘They have not paid due respect to Allah. The whole earth will be gripped in His hands on the Day of Judgment and the heavens will be just like a scroll in His right hand. Allah is by far more Glorious and High to be considered equal to their idols.’ (39:67) Whoever reads them will be safe from burns and drowning. [The man read them and fire broke out in the homes of his neighbors. His house was in the middle but remained unaffected]. Then another man stood up and said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’Minin (a.s.) my horse is unyielding and I am afraid of it.’ The Imam said, ‘Read in his right ear: “. . . all that is in the heavens and the earth have submitted themselves to His will, either by their own free will or by force? To Allah all things do return.” (3:83) [He read the above verse and his horse became subservient]. Another man stood up and said, ‘O Amir al- Mu’Minin, my land is filled with wild beasts. They overwhelm my house to get their prey.’ The Imam said, ‘Read: “A Messenger from your own people has come to you. Your destruction and suffering is extremely distressful to him. He really cares about you and is very compassionate and merciful to the believers.”’ (9:128) (Muhammad), if they turn away from you, say, ‘Allah is sufficient (support) for me. No one deserves to be worshipped except Allah. In Him 1 trust and He is the Owner of the Great Throne.’ (9:129) [This man also was saved from the beasts after reading the Quranic reading]. “Thereafter another man stood up and said, ‘O Amir al- Mu’Minin, in my stomach there is yellow water. Is there any cure for it?’ The Imam said yes, without dirham and dinar, ‘Write verse 255 of Chapter 2 of the Holy Quran on your stomach, then wash and drink it to save it in your stomach, you will be cured by the will of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy.’ [This man also followed the instruction and was cured]. Another man stood up and asked about his straying animal. The Imam said, ‘Read Chapter 36 in two Rak’at (a prayer consisting of two times bowing down on one’s knees) prayer and say, “O guide of the straying, return my straying animal to me.’ [This man also followed the instruction and his animal was returned]. Another man stood up and said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, tell me about a runaway.’ The Imam said, ‘Read: “Or they (the deeds of the unbelievers) are like the darkness of a deep, stormy sea with layers of giant waves, covered by dark clouds. It is darkness upon darkness whereby even if one stretches out his hands, he cannot see them. One can have no light unless Allah gives him light.’” (24:40) [He followed the instruction and his runaway person was found]. Thereafter another man stood up and said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, tell me about theft. Every night they steal my things.’ The Imam said, ‘When going to bed read, “(Muhammad), tell them, ‘It is all the same whether you call Him Allah or the Beneficent. All the good names belong to Him. (Muhammad), do not be very loud or slow in your prayer. Choose a moderate way of praying.’ (17:110) Say, ‘It is only Allah who deserves all praise. . . .’ (17:111) Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) has said, ‘If one is in an uninhabited land at night the angels will guard him and devils move away from him upon his reading this: ‘Your Lord is Allah Who established His dominion over the Throne (of the realm) after having created the heavens and the earth in six days. He made the night darken the day, which it pursues at a (considerable) speed and He made the sun and the moon submissive to His command. Is it not He who creates and governs all things? Blessed is Allah, the Cherisher of the Universe.’ (7:54) The narrator has said that a man traveled and stayed at a mined town without reading the above verse of the Holy Quran, Satan overwhelmed him and was holding his face. His (Satan’s) friend told him to wait. It made the man wake up and read the above verse of the Holy Quran. Satan then said to his friend, ‘May Allah humiliate you, now stay here to guard him till morning.’ In the morning he came to Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) and informed him of the incident saying, ‘In your words I found cure and truth.’ After sunrise he went to the place and he found a bunch of the hairs of the devil on the ground.’” ",

The angel of death will then say, ‘My Lord has commanded me to listen to Him, obey Him and will not take his spirit out without His commanding me to do so. When He commands me, then I take his spirit out.’ The angel of death remains with him until he commands to take his spirit out.

This is only something falsely invented.’ Allah, the Most High, then sent this: ‘Sad. I swear by the Quran, which is full of reminders of Allah (that you are a Messenger) (38:1). In fact, the unbelievers are the ones who are boastful and quarrelsome (38:2). How many ancient generations did We destroy?

This is certainly strange.’ (38:5) ‘A group of the pagans walked out of a meeting with the Prophet and told the others, ‘Let us walk away. Be steadfast in the worship of your gods.

If he finds one enjoying bounties, he then turns his anguish against that person’s family, and if he did not have family, he turns against his servants, and if he did not have any servant he then remains sleepless for the whole night and spends the day in anguish and anger. ‘Once a man from Ansar (people of Madinah) came to the Messenger of Allah and said, “I have purchased a house in the neighborhood of such and such tribe. The nearest neighbor is as such that not only do I not have any hope for receiving any good from him, I do not feel safe from him also.” The Imam said that the Messenger of Allah commanded Ali (a.s.) Salman, abu Dharr and, I forgot the other one, 1 think he mentioned Miqdad, to announce in the Mosque at the top of their voices, “One from whose hands his neighbors are not safe has no belief and faith.” They announced it three times.
