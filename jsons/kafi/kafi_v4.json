When my father would give charity, he would place it in the hand of the person asking for help, then take it back from him, kiss and smell it, and then give it back to him.

Someone among his disciples said, ‘O the Spirit and Word of Allah, why did you throw your bread in the water, it was your food for the day?’ Jesus replied, ‘I did it for the living things in the ocean that may eat it and the reward for it with Allah is great.’” "

However, he would not appeal before the Imam or other people for any help. A man said to ’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, ‘This man has not appealed before you. One is enough for him instead of five Awsaq.’ ’Amir al-Mu’minin then said, ‘I wish Allah will not create more people like you among the believers. Why do you exercise stinginess about the charity that I have decided to give to a needy person? You must take notice, for the sake of Allah! If I give charity to a person who expects to receive charity from me only after his appeal, I, in fact, have not given him the cost of what I have already taken from him. Such cost is my causing him to risk the dignity of his face, which he places on the ground before my Lord and his Lord during his worship and his appeal before Him for his needs. With this kind of dealing with a Muslim whom one knows as deserving of one’s charity and gifts, one has not proved oneself as truthful before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in one’s prayer when one appeals verbally before Allah to admit one’s Muslim brother into Paradise. On the other hand, one exercises stinginess in matters of worthless worldly belongings. This happens when a servant of Allah says in his prayer, ‘O Allah, grant forgiveness to male and female believers.’ Appealing for forgiveness is asking Paradise for male and female believers. It is unjust not to support one’s words with one’s deeds.’” "

Ahmad ibn Idris and others have narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad from Ahmad ibn Nuh ibn ‘Abd Allah from al-Dhuhliy in a marfu‘ who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that charity is that which is given before an appeal by the recipient. Giving charity after an appeal by the recipient is compensation for using the dignity of his face when he appealed and his passing the night worried and anxious in hope and despair without knowing which direction to go for his needs. He then decides to come before you with his heart beating fast and his muscles shaking. You can see (the color of) his blood on his face. He does not know whether he will turn back sadly or with happiness.’” "

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn Sandal from Yasir from al-Yasa’ ibn Hamzah who has said the following: “Once I was in the presence of abu al-Hassan al-Rida, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and I was speaking to him before a large gathering that wanted to ask him about lawful and unlawful matters. At such time, a tall man of fair complexion came in and offered his greetings of peace, addressing the Imam as ‘O child of the Messenger of Allah, I am from those who love you and your ancestors. I am coming from Hajj. I have lost my supplies as well as whatever was with me. I cannot reach my destination. If you consider it proper, help me so I can go home. It will be a great favor to me. When I arrive home, I will give as charity whatever amount you ask me to give; I am an undeserving recipient of charity.’ The Imam said, ‘Sit down. May Allah grant you blessing.’ He then spoke to people until they left. Only he (the Imam), Sulayman al-Ja’fariy, Khaythamah and I remained. The Imam then asked, ‘Can I go inside?’ Sulayman said, ‘Allah has already given priority to your affairs.’ He went inside where he remained for a while before he came out and closed the door. He then stretched his hand from the top of the door and said, ‘Where is the man from Khuransan?’ The man replied, ‘Here I am.’ The Imam said, ‘Get this two hundred dinar, use it for expenses and enjoy its blessings. You must not give any charity on my behalf. You may leave before I see you or you see me.’ Then the Imam came out, and Sulayman said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, you have been generous and kind to him. Why did you hide your face from him?’ The Imam replied, ‘I was afraid to see the effect of humiliation on his face due to appealing for help. Consider the words of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, that say, “Giving charity out of public sight is equal in reward to seventy times performing Hajj. One who publicizes sins is disgraced, and those who do not do so are granted forgiveness.” Consider the words of the people who lived long before: “Whenever during a day I come to him to appeal for help, I return home without any damage to the dignity of my face.’”” "

In so doing, they will receive preference, which will strengthen your affairs. Thereafter, you can reassume your program of equal distribution of the treasury among people as Allah has commanded you to do.’ ’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘Do you, fie upon you, make me to achieve victory through doing injustice to Muslim people, whose ruler and high authority I have become? By Allah, I will not do so as long as there is day and night and one star in the sky (is left). By Allah, even if their wealth (public treasury) was my personal wealth, I still would distribute it among them by equal measures; in fact, it (public treasury) is their wealth.’ He (the Imam) remained silent for a long time. He then raised his head and said, ‘Whoever of you is wealthy must avoid spending in a wasteful, wrongful, extravagant manner and for causes of falsehood. In so doing, one enhances the name of his friend among people, but brings it low before Allah. Whoever spends his wealth for the causes of falsehood or undeserving recipients, Allah deprives him of the blessings of their thanks and appreciation. They will love people other than such a benevolent person. Even if certain ones among them express their appreciation, thanks and good advice, it is no more than meaningless flattery and false expressions. If the shoes of their companion slip and he becomes needy of their support and returning the favor, he receives blames as a wicked friend. One of you must not spend his property for the causes of falsehood and for the undeserving recipients; otherwise, he receives no more than lip service from those who want all powers for themselves. Only wicked people may applaud him as long as he provides them favors. Only ignorant people may offer him meaningless praise. They may call him the most generous person, while in fact, in the sight of Allah he is a stingy one. No share, in fact, is more wicked and of greater loss than this share. What meaningful gain can I make through this kind of Benevolent Assistance? Whoever among you is wealthy should therefore maintain good relations with his relatives, serve his guests, provide relief to the suffering people, the captives and those who have lost their supply while on a journey; success in such matters is a noble achievement in this world and an honor in the next life.’” "

Whoever asks you for help, you must not turn him away empty-handed. If any of your uncles asks you for help, you must not give him less than fifty dinars; but it is up to you if you want to give more. If any of your aunts asks you for help, you must not give her less than twenty-five dinars, but it is up to you if you want to give more. I want Allah to grant you higher position.

It is my opinion and the opinion of my people that of all fasting, only that in the month of Ramadan is obligatory.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is not as you, O Zuhriy, say it is. Fasting is of forty kinds. Ten kinds of fasting are obligatory, just as is fasting during the month of Ramadan. Another ten kinds are prohibited. In fourteen kinds of fasting, one has the choice to fast or not to fast. For three kinds of fasting, one needs permission. One kind is for discipline, one is permissible, and one is fasting on a journey and fasting of an ill person.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for Your cause; please explain them to me.’ “The Imam then said, ‘Of the obligatory fasting there is (1) fasting during the month of Ramadan. (2) Two consecutive months of fasting are obligatory as expiation of zihar (swearing to consider one’s wife as one’s mother). This is because of the words of Allah, most High, “Those who pronounce zihar against their wives and then decide to take back their words must set free one slave before resuming marital relations . . . But those who cannot find this must fast for two consecutive months.” (58:2-3) (3) Fasting is obligatory for two consecutive months because of failing to fast one day in the month of Ramadan. (4) Two consecutive months of fasting are obligatory for killing a person by mistake for one who is unable to set free one slave and payment of wergild, blood money, to the people of the person killed. It is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who kills a believing person by mistake must set free one believing slave and pay blood money to the people of the person killed . . . but those who cannot do the above must fast for two consecutive months and repent before Allah. Allah knows all things and He is all wise.” (4:92) (5) Fasting for three days is obligatory as expiation for swearing because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Three days of fasting (is obligatory) as expiation for swearing when you do so.” (5:89) This is when one is unable to serve food for this reason. All such fasting must be completed in consecutive order and without intervals in between. Of such obligatory fasting is (6) that due to shaving one’s head during Hajj due to discomfort in the head. This is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who is ill or feels discomfort in his head pays expiation in the form of fasting or serving food, or animal sacrifice. . .” (2:196) In this case, the person has the choice between serving food and fasting for three days. Of such obligatory fasting is (7) that due to Tamattu‘ (enjoying the interval between ‘Umrah and Hajj) and one’s inability to offer a sacrifice. This is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who enjoys (the interval) between ‘Umrah and Hajj and cannot offer a sacrifice must fast three days during Hajj and seven more days after Hajj at home. This makes it ten complete days of fasting.” Of such obligatory fasting is (8) that due to hunting. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “One who knowingly kills an animal must as penalty slaughter a similar animal. This is determined by two just persons deeming it to be similar with the animal hunted. Such an animal then must be offered as a sacrificial animal sent to Ka‘bah or he must serve food to destitute people or fast an equal number of days.’” (5:95) ‘Do you, O Zuhriy, know what is an equal number of days of fasting?’ the Imam asked. I (Zuhriy) replied, ‘No, I do not know.’ The Imam then said, ‘First, the price for the animal hunted is found. With such (money), wheat is then purchased and the total amount of wheat is divided into Sa‘ (about 3 kg) and for each one and half kilogram of wheat he has to fast for one day. Of such fasting is (9), that for an obligatory vow and (10) fasting for Ttikaf. ‘Of the unlawful fasting, there is (1) fasting on the first day of Shawwal, (‘id of al-Fitr), (2) on the tenth of Dhul Hajjah, (3-5) three days of al-Tashriq, 11, 12 and 13 of Dhul Hajjah. (6) Fasting (with an intention for fasting as a day of the month of Ramadan) is unlawful on a day that cannot be identified with certainty. In such a case, there is a command and a prohibition upon us. We are commanded to fast considering it as the last day of the month of Sha‘ban, and we are prohibited to fast considering it as the first day of the month of Ramadan when people have doubts about its being the first day of the month of Ramadan.’ I (Zuhriy) then asked, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, what happens if it, in fact, is not of the month of Sha‘ban at all?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If he fasts with an intention of fasting a day of the month of Sha‘ban, and in fact, it happens to be of the month of Ramadan, his fasting is counted for the month of Ramadan. If one thinks it to be a day of the month of Ramadan and, in fact, it is a day of the month of Sha‘ban, it does not harm him in any way.’ I (Zuhriy) then asked, ‘How can an optional fast replace an obligatory fast?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘If one fasts during the month of Ramadan with an intention for optional fast, it is counted for the obligatory fast of the month of Ramadan as a replacement. Of such fasting is (7) fasting for two days without any break in between, (8) the fasting to remain speechless and silent, (9) fasting for an unlawful vow, and (10) fasting for all the time is unlawful. ‘The fasting in which one has the choice is (1-2) fasting on Friday and Thursday. Of such fasting, are (3-6) the days (of brightness) in the middle of the month, (7-13) fasting six days of the month of Shawwal after the month of Ramadan, (14) fasting on the ninth of Dhul Hajjah, and fasting on the tenth of the month of Muharram. In all such days, one has the choice to fast or not to fast. ‘The fasting for which one needs to have permission is (1) fasting of a woman optionally; she needs to have permission from her husband; (2) a slave for optional fasting needs the permission of his master; (3) and a guest for optional fasting needs the permission of his host. The Messenger of Allah has said, “One who is a guest of a people must not fast without permission from his host.” ‘Of fasting for discipline (1) one is the fasting of a growing child (about to become mature) for discipline, not as an obligation. (2) Two is the fasting of a person on a journey who has used food at the beginning of the day, who should abstain from eating for the rest of the day when he arrives home, but it is not an obligation. Of the permissible fasting, is (3) the case of one, who by mistake, eats, drinks or vomits unintentionally; Allah for him has made it lawful and his fasting is considered valid. “About the fasting of a traveler and one suffering from an illness, ’Ammah (non-Shi`a) have different ideas. Certain ones among them say one must fast. Others say that one must not fast. Yet another group says that he may or may not fast, that the choice is his. We, however, say that in both cases he must not fast (it is unlawful fasting). If one fasts while on a journey or suffering from an illness, he must fast again later to make up for his invalid fasting. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Those of you who are ill or on a journey must fast an equal number of days during other times.” (2:187) This is how fasting is explained.’” "

Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Man is aware of himself. . . .” (75:14) They replied, ‘We have no illness.’ ’Amir al-Mu’minin then laughed and said, ‘Do you testify that no one deserves worship except Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?’ They replied, ‘We testify that no one deserves worship except Allah, but we do not know Muhammad.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He is the Messenger of Allah.’ They replied, ‘We do not know him to be as such. He was only an Arab person who called people to himself.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘If you do not testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, I will execute you.’ They replied, ‘Do as you wish.’ He then ordered Shurta al-Khamis (special police) to guard and take them behind the city of Kufa. He ordered them to dig two ditches next to each other with a hole joining the two ditches. He (the Imam) then said to them, ‘I will place you in one of these two ditches and start a fire in the other one and make you die because of smoke.’ They said, ‘Do as you wish. This life ends anyway.’ They were gently placed in the ditch, then he (the Imam) gave the order to start a fire in the other ditch and kept calling them repeatedly; each time they replied, ‘You can do as you wish,’ until they died. He then returned, but the news spread and people spoke about it. One day he (the Imam) was in the Masjid when a Jewish man from Yathrib, whom all Jews of Yathrib confirmed to be the most knowledgeable one among them, as was his ancestors, and a group of people of his family, came to ’Amir al-Mu’minin. When they arrived near the great Masjid of al-Kufa, they disembarked, then stood at the door of the Masjid and sent someone to ’Amir al-Mu’minin with a message that said, ‘We are a group of Jewish people. We have come from Hijaz and we need to speak to you. Do you want to come out or should we enter to see you?’ The narrator has said that he (the Imam) then went out to them, saying, ‘They will soon enter and begin with oath. What do you need?’ The chief person among them asked, ‘O son of abu Talib, what is this innovation that you have introduced in the religion of Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause?’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘What kind of innovation are you talking about?’ The Jewish man said, ‘People of Hijaz say that you executed by means of smoke certain men. They were a people who testified that it is only Allah who alone deserves worship but would not testify that Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, is the Messenger of Allah.’ ’Amir al-Mu’minin said, ‘I swear you upon the nine miracles that were given to Moses, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, on Mount Sinai. I swear you upon the five temples of al-Quds and the position of the Judge. Do you know that Usha‘ ibn Nun, after the death of Moses, before whom a people were brought who had testified that Allah alone deserves worship, but did not testify that Moses was the Messenger of Allah, executed them the way I did?’ The Jewish man replied, ‘Yes, I testify that you are a keeper of the secrets of Moses.’ The narrator has said that he then took out of the pocket of his gown a book (letter) and gave it to ’Amir al-Mu’minin who opened it, looked at it and wept. The Jewish man then asked, ‘What makes you weep, O son of abu Talib? You just looked at a letter that is in the Suryaniy language, and you are an Arab man. Do you know what is in it?’ ’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said to him, ‘Yes, I know. This is my name written in it.’ The Jewish man then asked, ‘Show me your name in this book (letter) and tell me what your name is in the Suryaniy language?’ The narrator has said, ‘’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, showed him his name on the page and said, “My name in Suryaniy language is ‘Eliya’.” The Jewish man then said, ‘I testify that only Allah deserves worship, Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, is the Messenger of Allah, and you are the executor of the will of Muhammad. I testify that you have more authority over the people than they themselves do after Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause.’ They pledged allegiance to ’Amir al-Mu’minin and entered the Masjid, and said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah before whom I was not forgotten. All praise belongs to Allah who listed me in the book (page) before Him along with the virtuous ones. All praise belongs to Allah, the owner of glory and honor.’” "

Muhammad ibn Yahya and others have narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad from Musa ibn ‘Umar from ibn Sinan from abu Sa‘id al-Qammat from Bukayr ibn A’yan who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, ‘For what reason has Allah placed the Black Stone at the corner where it is and not in other places? Why should one kiss it, why is it taken out of paradise, why are servants of Allah’s covenant and undertaking placed in it and not in other things, and what is the reason for it? Explain to me and I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause. My thinking about this issue is strange.’ The narrator has said that he (the Imam) then said, ‘You asked it, complicated the issue and brought up many things. Understand the answer, make room in your heart (pay attention) and listen carefully. I will explain to you by the will of Allah. Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, placed the Black Stone, which is a special substance taken out of paradise for Adam, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. It was placed on the corner (of Ka‘bah) because of the covenant. This is because when the offspring of Adam were taken out of their backs, when Allah made a covenant with them on that place and at that place it (the Black Stone) was shown to them. From that place, the bird will fly for al-Qa’im, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. The first one to pledge allegiance with him will be that bird, and he by Allah is Jibril, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. Against that place will al-Qa’im lean his back. This is the guide and proof in favor of al-Qa’im. It is a witness in favor of those who fulfill their responsibility toward him (al-Qa’im), at that place, and the witness in favor of those who entrusted it with proof of their acting according to the covenant and undertaking Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, had made with them. The reason for kissing and touching the Black Stone is the covenant. It is to renew the covenant and undertaking and to renew the allegiance. It is for them to reaffirm in front of it (the Black Stone) the covenant that Allah had made with them on the day of covenant and undertaking. They therefore come to it every year to reaffirm in front of it the covenant and trust with which they were entrusted. Consider what you say in front of the Black Stone, “This is my trust which I am returning, my undertaking that I had assumed. So bear witness in my favor that I have fulfilled my obligation.” I swear by Allah, no one returns this trust except our Shi`a. No one has preserved that undertaking and covenant except our Shi ‘ah. They come to it (the Black Stone) and it recognizes them and acknowledges their truthfulness. Others come to it, but it does not recognize them and rejects their assertion; no one other than you has preserved the covenant. In your favor, by Allah, it will testify and against them. It will testify to their disregard of the covenant, their rejection and denial of the same. Such testimony will be the ultimate argument from Allah against them on the Day of Judgment. On that day, it (the Black Stone) will come, and it will have a speaking tongue and two eyes, in its original form. All creatures will recognize it and no one will deny it. It will testify in favor of those who fulfilled the obligation about the covenant, renewed their commitment and undertaking in front of it, reaffirming their commitment to preserve the covenant and undertaking and returning the trust. It will testify against those who deny, reject and forget the covenant, to prove them rejecters and unbelievers.’ “The reason why Allah took it out of paradise; ‘Do you know what the Black Stone was?’ I (the narrator) replied, ‘No, I do not know.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It was an angel of the great angels before Allah. When Allah made a covenant with the angels, the first to believe and affirm the covenant was that angel. Allah then chose him as a trustee for all of His creatures. He fed him the covenant and kept it with him for safekeeping. He then commanded all creatures to worship Him and to renew before it (angel, now the Black Stone) every year the covenant, the undertaking that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, had made with them. Allah then assigned it with Adam in paradise to remind him of the covenant, and he would renew his confirmation before it every year. When Adam disobeyed and was expelled from paradise, Allah made him forget the undertaking and covenant, which Allah had made with him and his offspring in favor of Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and the executor of his will, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He left him lost and confused. When Allah accepted Adam’s repentance, He changed that angel to a white diamond and threw it to Adam from paradise, while he was in the land of India. When he looked at it, he found comfort with it but he did not recognize it. He did not know about it more than being a diamond. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, made it speak, saying, “O Adam, do you know me?” He replied, “No, I do not know you.” It then said, “Yes, Satan attacked you to make you forget to speak of your Lord.” It then changed into the form in which it lived with Adam in paradise. It then said to Adam, “Where is the covenant and undertaking?” Adam then rushed toward it, remembered the covenant, commitment, wept, expressed humbleness before it, kissed it and renewed the affirmation of the commitment and covenant. Then Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, changed it into the substance of the white diamond stone, very clear and shiny. Adam then lifted it up on his shoulder out of respect and its greatness. When he experienced fatigue, Jibril would pick it up until he brought it all the way to Makkah. In Makkah, he continued to seek comfort with it and renew his affirmation of the covenant every day and night. “Thereafter, when Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, built the Ka‘bah, He placed it at that place; when Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, made the covenant with the offspring of Adam, He did so at that place and at that place He fed the angel with the covenant. For this reason, it is placed at that corner. He moved Adam away from the location of the House to al-Safa’, Hawwa’ (Eve) was sent to al-Marwah and placed the Stone at that corner. When Adam looked from al-Safa’ he found that the Stone is placed at that corner, he said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), Tahlil (Only Allah deserves worship) and spoke of His glory. For this reason, it is the tradition to say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) when facing, from al-Safa’, that corner where the Black Stone is placed. Allah has entrusted the covenant and undertaking with it and not with other angels. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, made them to form the covenant and confirm His being the Lord. (They were asked to confirm Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, as being the Prophet of Allah and to confirm Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, as being the executor of the will. This made the angels tremble in awe. The first to rush to affirm was that angel. No one among them had such an intense love for Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and his family as that angel did. For this reason, Allah chose him from among the others and fed him the covenant. On the Day of Judgment, he will come with a speaking tongue, seeing eyes, and will testify in favor of all those who had gone to that place and had fulfilled their obligation about the covenant.’” "

I asked, ’May Allah keep you well, what is al-Sharjab?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It means ‘taller’ than others.’ The man said, ‘Al-Salamu ‘Alaykum’ and he brought his head between my father and me.

He said, ‘I have a question, may Allah grant you blessings.’ My father said to him, ‘Allow us to complete our Tawaf, then you can ask your question.’ When my father completed Tawaf we entered al-Hijr and said two Rak‘at salat (prayer). He (my father) turned around and asked, ‘Where is the man, son?’ He was just behind him and had completed his salat (prayer). My father asked, ‘Where from is the gentleman?’ He replied, ‘I am from al-Sham.’ He then asked, ‘From which people of al-Sham are you?’ He replied, ‘I am from the people of Bayt al- Maqdis.’ He (my father) asked, ‘Have you read the two books?’ He (the man) replied, ‘Yes, I have read them.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Ask your question.’ He said, ‘I like to ask about the beginning of this House, and about His words, “Nun, and by the pen with which you write” (67:1) and about His words, “...those in whose properties there is a certain share for the needy and deprived.’” (75:25-26) He (the Imam) then said, ‘O brother from al-Sham, listen to our Hadith and do not call it false. Those who call our Hadith false have called the words of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, as false, and those who do so have called the words of Allah as false. Those who call the words of Allah as false, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, subjects them to punishment. The beginning of the House was when Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, said to the angels, “I have decided to appoint a deputy on earth. . . .” (2:29) The angels responded to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, saying, “Do You want to appoint one who causes destruction and bloodshed therein?” He did not pay attention to them and they realized that it was due to His anger. They sought refuge with His Throne and Allah commanded an angel from among them to establish a house for Him in the sixth heaven, which was called al-Durrah parallel to His Throne. It was designed for the inhabitants of the heaven for Tawaf by seventy thousand angels every day, of whom no one had to return for Tawaf again. They ask forgiveness. When Adam descended to the heaven of the world, He commanded him to build this House. This is parallel to that house. This is designated for Adam and his offspring just as that is designated for those in the heaven.’ The man then said, ‘You have spoken the truth, O child of the Messenger of Allah.’” "

        "englishText": "1. Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Salih ibn abu Hammad from al-Husayn ibn Yazid from al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn abu Hamzah who has said the following: “Abu Ibrahim from abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, when Adam and his spouse were affected by the tree of wheat, expelled them from paradise and made them to descend to earth. Adam landed on al-Safa’ and Hawwa’ (Eve) landed on al- Marwah. Al-Safa’ is called by this name because it is derived from Adam’s name al-Mustafa’ (the chosen one) as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Allah chose Adam and Noah.” (3:33) Al-Marwah is called by this name because it is taken from the word al-Mar’ah (a woman). Adam then said to himself, “Allah has separated her from me is because she is not lawful for me anymore; had she been lawful for me she would descend with me on al-Safa’.” Adam waited away from Hawwa’. He would go to her at al-Marwah during the day and speak to her. At night, for fear that his desires may overcome him, would go back to al-Safa’ and pass the night there. Adam had no one beside Hawwa’ to comfort him and for this reason women are called al-Nisa’ (comforting). Hawwa’ was a source of comfort for Adam. Allah did not speak to him and did not send any messenger to him. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then accepted his repentance as a favor to him. He dictated to him certain words. Adam then spoke those words and Allah turned to him with the acceptance of his repentance. He then sent Jibril to him, who offered him the greeting of peace and said, “O repenting Adam, who has turned back from his mistakes and exercised patience on facing misfortune. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has sent me to you to teach the good deeds which when you practice will cleanse you.” He then took hold of his hand and moved to the site of the House. Allah sent a piece of cloud and it cast a shadow on the site of the House. The cloud was parallel to the established House in the heaven. Jibril said, “O Adam, draw a mark with your foot around the shadow of this cloud, that has covered the site. A house of diamond will soon emerge for you on this site, which will be a Qiblah for you and your descendants after you.” Adam did as he was told to do and Allah then made a house of diamond emerge for him under the cloud. Allah brought down the Black Stone, which at that time was intensely white, even more than milk and brighter than the sun. It turned black because of the pagans’ touch and because of their filth. Jibril commanded Adam to ask forgiveness from Allah for his sin, near all the reminders (of Allah) and would tell him that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has forgiven him. He commanded him to pick up pebbles, to throw on al-Jamar, from al-Muzdalifah (name of a place). When he arrived at the place of al-Jamar, Satan countered him and said, “O Adam, where are you going?” Jibril told Adam not to speak to him, pelt him with seven pebbles and say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) with each throw. Adam did as he was told to do until he completed throwing pebbles on al-Jamar. He then commanded him to offer a sacrifice, the offering, which is done before throwing pebbles. He commanded him to shave his head to express humbleness before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. Adam did as he was told to do. He (Jibril) then commanded him to visit the House, walk seven times around it and walk seven times between al-Safa’ and al-Marwah, beginning from al-Safa’ to end at al-Marwah. Thereafter walk seven times around the House, which is called Tawaf of women. Without this Tawaf, carnal relation remains unlawful. Adam completed this Tawaf and Jibril said to him, “Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has forgiven your sin, accepted your repentance and your returning to Him. He has made your spouse lawful for you.” Adam then left, his sin was forgiven, his return to Allah was accepted and his spouse became lawful for him.’” "

        "englishText": "2. A number of our people have narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Qalanisiy from Ali ibn Hassan from his uncle ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Kathir who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that when Adam landed on al-Safa’ and it is called al- Safa’; al-Mustafa (the chosen one) landed there. For this reason it is called (al-Safa’); it is derived from Adam’s name al-Mustafa’ (the chosen one) as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Allah chose Adam and Noah, the family of Ibrahim and family of ‘Imran over the worlds.” (3:33) Hawwa’ (Eve) landed on al-Marwah. Al-Marwah is called by this name because it is taken from the word al-Mar’ah (a woman). Al-Safa’ and al-Marwah are two hills on the right side of al-Ka‘bah. Adam then said to himself, ‘Allah separated her from me; she is not lawful for me anymore. Adam waited away from Hawwa’. He would go to her at al-Marwah during the day and speak to her, and at night, for fear that his desires may overcome him, would go back to al-Safa’ and pass the night there. Adam had no one beside Hawwa’ to comfort him and for this reason women are called al-Nisa’ (comforting). Hawwa’ was a source of comfort for Adam. Adam waited in this condition as long as Allah wanted. Allah did not speak to him and did not send any messenger to him. The Lord, to who belongs glory, expressed pride before the angels because of Adam’s exercising patience. When the time came when Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, decided to accept his repentance, He sent Jibril to him who offered him the greeting of peace and said, “O repenting Adam, who has turned back from his mistakes and has exercised patience on facing misfortune. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has sent me to you to teach you the good deeds which when you practice will cleanse you.” He then took hold of his hand and moved to the site of the House. Allah sent a piece of cloud and it cast a shadow on the site of the House. Jibril said, “O Adam, draw a mark with your foot around the shadow of this cloud, that has covered the site. It will be a Qiblah for you and your descendents after you.” Adam did as he was told to do. He (Jibril) then left with him to Mina and showed him the Masjid of Mina. He, Adam, drew a line with his foot. He marked the site of the Sacred Masjid after marking the site of the House. He (Jibril) then left from Mina to ‘Arafat and made him to stay at al- Mu‘arraf. He (Jibril) said, “When it is sunset, confess to your sins seven times and ask forgiveness and repentance from Allah, seven times.” Adam did as he was told to do. For this reason it is called al- Mu‘arraf; Adam confessed there to his sin and made a tradition for his offspring to confess to their sin as Adam had done and that they should repent as Adam had done. Then he (Jibril) commanded him to leave ‘Arafat. He passed by the seven hills and he (Jibril) commanded him to say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) near each hill four times. Adam did as he was told to do. He then arrived in Jam‘ by which time one third of the night had passed. He said his Maghrib and ‘Isha prayer without interval in between at that night at that place. He (Jibril) then commanded him to rest in Batha’, where Adam did so, until morning. He (Jibril) then commanded him to climb the hill of Jam‘ (al- Muzdalifah) when it is sunrise, confess to his sins seven times and ask Allah for forgiveness and repentance seven times. Adam then did as he (Jibril) had told him to do. He made it two confessions so it becomes a tradition for his offspring. Those of them who cannot attend ‘Arafat but can attend Jam‘ (al-Muzdalifah), their Hajj is good so far. He then left for Mina from Jam‘. At noontime, he arrived in Mina and he (Jibril) commanded him to pray two-Rak‘ats prayer in the Masjid of Mina. Then he (Jibril) commanded him to offer a sacrifice before Allah, so it is accepted from him, and take notice that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has turned to him, and it (offering sacrifice) becomes a tradition for his offspring. Adam offered a sacrifice. Allah accepted it from him and sent a fire from the sky. Adam’s sacrifice was accepted. He (Jibril) said, “O Adam, Allah has done a favor to you by teaching you the good deeds because of which He has turned to you and has accepted your sacrifice. Shave your head to express humbleness before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, for His accepting your sacrifice.” Adam shaved his head to express humbleness before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. He (Jibril) then held Adam’s hand and left toward the House. On the way, Satan countered him near al-Jamarah. Satan, may he be condemned, asked, “O Adam, where are you going?” He (Jibril) said to Adam, “Pelt him with seven pebbles and say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) once with each pelting.” Adam did as he was told to do and Satan went away. He (Satan) encountered him again near the second al-Jamarah and asked, “O Adam, where are you going?” He (Jibril) said, “O Adam, pelt him with seven pebbles and say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) seven times, once with each pelting.” Adam did as he was told to do and Satan went away. Satan then encountered him near the third al-Jamarah and asked, “O Adam, where do you want to go?” He (Jibril) said, “Pelt him with seven pebbles and say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) seven times, once with each pelting.” Adam did as he was told to do and Satan went away. He (Jibril) said, “From this time on, you will not see him again.” He (Jibril) then left with him for the House and commanded him to do Tawaf (walk) around the House seven times. Adam did as was told to do. He (Jibril) said, to him, “Allah has forgiven your sin, accepted your repentance and has made your spouse lawful for you.”’” NOTE:Muhammad ibn abu ‘ Abd Allah has narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from Muhammad ibn Sinan from ‘Abd al-Karim ibn ‘Amr and Isma‘il ibn Hazim from ‘Abd al-Hamid ibn abu al-Daylam from abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, a similar Hadith.

I granted mercy to Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve) when they complained to Me the way they did. Descend down to them with a tent from paradise; provide them comfort on My behalf on their separation from paradise. Call them in one tent; I have granted them mercy due to their weeping, their fear and feeling lonely. Pitch the tent on al-Tur‘ah (a high place) in the mountains of Makkah’. He (the Imam) said, ‘Al-Tur’ah is the site of the House and its pillars that angels had raised before Adam.’ Jibril descended down with the tent, which was of the size of the site of the House, and its pillars. He (Jibril) pitched up the tent.’ He (the Imam) said, ’Jibril then asked Adam to come down from al-Safa’ and asked Hawwa’ to come down from al-Marwah. He (Jibril) brought them in one tent.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The pole of the tent was a pole made of red ruby, its light and rays shone at the hills of Makkah and its surroundings.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The light of the pole then extended.’ He (the Imam) said, ’Places on which the light from the pole fell became known as part of the Sacred Area today.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Allah made such area sacred due to the sanctity of the tent and the pole; they were from paradise.’ He (the Imam) said, ’For this reason Allah counts both good deeds and evil deeds in multiples.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Ropes of the tent were extended around it to fasten to the pegs which in turn mark the limits of the area of the Sacred Masjid.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The pegs were of pure gold and the ropes were of purple color fibers from paradise.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent revelation to Jibril that said, ‘Allow seventy thousand angels to guard the tent against satanic disobedient ones, comfort Adam and perform Tawaf around the tent to show the greatness of the House and the tent.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Jibril came with the angels and they were guards at the tent against disobedient and violent individuals of Satan. They performed Tawaf around the House and the tent every day and night just as they did around the established House in the heaven.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The pillars of the Sacred House on earth stand parallel with the Established House in the heaven.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent thereafter revelation to Jibril that said, “You must go to Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve), move them away from the pillars of the House and raise the pillars of the House for my angels, then for the children of Adam.” Jibril came to Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve), moved them away from the tent and al- Tur‘ah of the House and removed the tent from al-Tur‘ah (the site of the House).’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Adam was placed on al-Safa’ and Hawwa’ was placed on al-Marwah. Adam then asked Jibril, “Is it because of the anger of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, that you have moved us and separated us from each other or with His agreement and measures for us?” He (Jibril) told them that it was not due to Allah’s anger against both of them but Allah cannot be questioned for what He does. O Adam, the seventy thousand angels that Allah has sent to earth provide you comfort; you must perform Tawaf around the pillars of the House, the Established one, and the tent. They asked Allah to build for them instead of the tent a house on the site of al-Tur‘ah, the blessed one, parallel to the Established House in the heaven so they can perform Tawaf around it, as they do around the Established House in the heaven. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then sent to me revelation to move you away and the tent. Adam then said, “We are happy with the measures of Allah and whatever He commands about us.” The pillars of the Sacred House were raised with one stone from al-Safa’, one from al-Marwah, one from Mount Sinai and one from the Mount Peace which is behind al-Kufa. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent revelation to Jibril to build and complete it. Jibril then dug out the four stones by the command of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, from their places by his wing, and placed them on the corners of the House in places of the pillars marked and measured by the Almighty, as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, had commanded him to do. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then sent revelation to Jibril that said, “You must build and complete it with stones from abu Qubays and make two doors for it, one to the east and one to the west.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘He (Jibril) completed it. When he finished, angels performed Tawaf around it. When Adam and Hawwa’ looked to the angels performing Tawaf around the House, they moved to perform Tawaf by walking around it seven times and then they went out in search for food.’” "

Muhammad ibn abu ‘Abd Allah has narrated from Muhammad ibn abu Yusr from Dawud ibn ‘Abd Allah from Muhammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Muhammad from ‘Isa ibn Yunus who has said the following: “Ibn abu al-‘Awja’ was one of the pupils of al-Hassan al-Basriy. He deviated from the belief of Monotheism. It was said to him, ‘You have given up the religion of your friend and have come to something that has no foundation and reality.’ He replied, ‘My friend was mixing the issue. One time he would say, “It is predestination” and then he would say, “It is compulsion.” I do not know if he believes in any religion with which he can continue.’ He went to Makkah, in disobedience and in rejection of belief in performing Hajj. Scholars disliked to sit and to speak with him due to his bad mouth and filthy conscience. He went to abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and sat next to him in the company of people like him, and said, ‘O abu ‘Abd Allah, meeting places are trusts where everyone can cough if one needs to cough. Will you allow speaking?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You can speak.’ He said, ‘For how long you continue walking around it like farmers threshing hay under their feet, seek refuge with this stone, worship this House built with bricks and rubble, run around like runaway camels? One who thinks a little about it comes to know of this action to be founded without wisdom and thinking. Say something about it; you’re the head of this matter and its peak, your father is the origin thereof and its completion.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘One whom Allah has made blind and has made him to go astray, he mistreats the truth and considers it tasteless; thus Satan becomes his source of authority and guardian, lord and companion, who leads to destructive places wherefrom he can never come out to safety. Through this house, Allah has asked His creatures to worship Him (acknowledge Him as their sole owner) so He may examine the quality of their obedience in their answering His call. He thus has strongly advised them to respect it with greatness and visit it. He has made it a place of His prophets and a point to face during performing salat (prayer). It is a branch of His pleasure, and it is a road and it leads to His forgiveness. It is established in perfect balance as a focal point of greatness and glory. Allah created it two thousand years before the spread of earth. He deserves more than anyone who is obeyed in what He commands and in what He prohibits and admonishes. Allah is the inventor of the spirits and forms.’” "

        "englishText": "2. It is narrated that ’Amir al-Mu’minin once said in his sermon the following: “’Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that if Allah, Glorious is whose praise, wanted, He could have opened to His prophets the treasures of gold (stored), mines of pure growing gold, placed at their disposal, gardens of plantations, flocks of birds from the skies and animals on land. Had He done so, trial and testing system would have failed as well, the system of reward; the news (about the hereafter) vanished, people resting would have been the same as those under trial and assessment. The believers would not receive any reward as people of good deeds, nor do any name and terminology make any clear sense. In addition, if Allah were to send from the sky miracles to force their neck down to submission, He could have done so, but trial and test would have remained without basis in the case of all people. However, Allah, Glorious is whose praise, made His messengers to possess determination in their intentions, but weak to the eyes of people. “It is due to such determination that their (prophet’s) ability to exercise moderation fills up the hearts and eyes with satisfaction, with feeling of self-sufficiency and their exercising of self-abnegation fills up the ears and eyes (without question). Had the prophets been powerful beyond the power of others, had they had incompatible might and a kingdom that every man desired, and every one sought to achieve, it would have been easy to examine the creatures and far for the creatures to assume arrogance. They (people) would believe them for crushing fear from them or for the attractive interest found with them (the prophets). In such case, the intentions and good deeds remained subject to equal division and distribution. Allah, however, wanted that following of His messengers, acknowledgement of His books, expressing humbleness before Him, seeking comfort with His commands, submission to His orders, remain especially for Him alone, without any confusion or doubts to affect its purity of being just for Him. The more there is trial and greater test, the reward and compensation is worthier and appreciable. Have you not noticed that Allah, Glorious is whose praise, has tried and tested from Adam to the last ones of this world by means of stones that do not harm anyone or benefit them, do not see or hear? Thus, He has made it His sacred house, which He has made for people a place of worship. He then has made its location in a most barren land with rocks, the least in terms of fertility, the narrowest of valleys and means of living, the most difficult in availability of water for Muslims. It is among the rough hills, fine sands, fountains of very little water and towns that are cut off from each other, with very little traces of the drops from the sky which do not even reach anyone’s shoes or cloven-hoofs or hooves. He then commanded Adam and his offspring to ready themselves to turn to it. It then became the turning point for the destination of their journey, the final destination for them to rest. To this destination, the fruits of hearts fall from the wilderness, and vast extended land, from the cut off island in the oceans, from the deep valley of faraway places. They move their shoulders with humbleness, declaring around it (the House) that no one except Allah deserves worship. They walk on sand, on foot, dusty and tired for His sake. (One can see them) without head covering and (normal) dress, their heads shaven for the great trial, and tremendous test, intense examination, slow purification and sifting and with clear appeals. Allah has made it a means to achieve His kindness, a connection and means to reach His paradise, a reason to gain His forgiveness. It is a trial for His creatures through His kindness. The reward would have been very little and small if the trial had been of a certain lesser degree. This could happen if Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, were to place His Sacred House and other great monumental landmarks among the gardens, canals, open flat lands, thick groves of trees, easily accessible fruits, plentiful grass, connected towns, with brown colored fields, green gardens, countryside houses surrounded with beautiful yards, delightful farms, well built roads and many gardens. “The trial would turn into ease and comfort if the foundations on which it is carried, the stones with which it is raised were of green emerald, red ruby, lights and rays. This would reduce the creeping of doubts in the chests, make the struggle of Satan against the hearts very weak, nullify the pricking of doubts and hesitation by the people. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, however, tests and examines His servants by various kinds of difficult examinations. He makes them to prove their loyalty as worshippers by a hard struggle. He tries by means of hardships to expel arrogance from their hearts and settle humbleness in their souls, so that it can open the door to His favors and provide easy means for His forgiveness and His trial, as He has said, ’Do people think that they will be left without trial just because they have said, “We have believed?” We certainly placed under test and trial those who lived before them so that Allah would find who was truthful and who were the liars.’” (29:1-2) "

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from Mu‘awiyah ibn ‘Ammar who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that when Ibrahim, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, left Isma‘il behind in Makkah, the child became thirsty. Between al-Safa’ and al-Marwah there was a tree. His mother went to al-Safa’ and called aloud, ‘1s there anyone, in the wilderness, to provide relief?’ No one answered. She then went to al-Marwah and called aloud, ‘1s there anyone in the wilderness to provide relief?’ No one answered. Then she went back to al-Safa’ and did the same thing repeatedly seven times. Allah made this a tradition. Jibril then came and asked her, ‘Who are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the mother of the child of Ibrahim.’ He (Jibril) then asked, ‘In whose care did he leave you?’ She replied, ‘Since you say this, I, when Ibrahim was leaving, asked him, “O Ibrahim, in whose care are you leaving us?” He replied, “I leave you in the care of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious).”’ He (Jibril) said, ‘He has certainly left you in the care of one who is a sufficient caretaker.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘People would avoid traveling through Makkah because of water scarcity. The child kicked his heels to search for water and make Zamzam flow.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She returned from al-Marwah to the child when water had already gushed out. She piled soil to allow water to accumulate for fear of its flowing away; had she not done so it would have flowed.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When birds saw the water they began to circle around. At this time, a caravan from Yemen passing by saw birds circling; they said, ‘Birds circle only where there is water.’ They came to them (mother and child) who gave them water and they (people) in turn gave them food. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in this way provided for them (mother and child) means of sustenance. People would pass by Makkah. They would feed them (mother and child) who in turn would give those (people) water.’” "

Muhammad ibn Yahya and Ahmad ibn Idris have narrated from ‘Isa ibn Muhammad ibn abu Ayyub from Ali ibn Mahziyar from al- Husayn ibn Sa‘id from Ali ibn Mansur from Kulthum ibn ‘Abd al-Mu’min al-Harraniy who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, commanded Ibrahim, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, to perform Hajj and that Isma‘il also perform Hajj along with him, and then settle him in the Sacred area. They went for Hajj on a red camel and there was no one with them except Jibril. When they arrived in the sacred area, Jibril said, ‘O Ibrahim, disembark and take a shower before entering the sacred area.’ They disembarked and took a shower. He (Jibril) instructed them how to prepare for Ihram, which they followed. He (Jibril) then commanded them to pronounce the reading to commence acts of Hajj and commanded to pronounce the four Talbiyat (O Allah, here I am O Allah; here I am to obey Your command). It is the pronouncement and the recitation, which is pronounced by the messengers. He (Jibril) went with them to al-Safa’. They then disembarked there. Jibril stood between them, facing the House. He said Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) and they also said Takbir (Allah is great beyond description). He said Tahlil (no one deserves worship except Allah) and they said Tahlil. He (Jibril) said Tahmid (all praise belongs to Allah). They also did the same. He (Jibril) pronounced Tamjid (all glory belongs to Allah). They also did as he had done. He (Jibril) praised Allah. They also praised Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, as he had done. He (Jibril) then moved forward. They also did as he was doing until they reached the Stone. He (Jibril) touched it and commanded them to do the same. He (Jibril) made them to perform Tawaf (walk seven times around the Ka‘bah). He (Jibril) then made them stand at the site of the station of Ibrahim. He (Jibril) performed two Rak‘at salat (prayer). They also did as he had done. He then explained to them how to perform the rest of the acts of Hajj, and when they completed the acts of Hajj, Allah commanded Ibrahim to go back. Isma‘il stayed and there was no one with him except his mother. The next time, Allah commanded Ibrahim to perform Hajj and build the Ka‘bah. Arabs would perform Hajj also, but it (al-Ka‘bah) had fallen in pieces; however, its foundation was clearly recognizable. Isma‘il collected the falling pieces of the wall; when people moved away, he placed them inside the Ka‘bah. When Allah commanded him to build, Ibrahim came and said, ‘Son, Allah has commanded us to build al-Ka‘bah.’ They uncovered it and it was one red piece of stone only. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then commanded them to set the foundation of al-Ka‘bah on it. Allah, the Most Majestic, the most Glorious, sent four angels who collected stones for him. Ibrahim and Isma‘il would build and the angels would bring stones to them. When completed, it was twelve yards high and they made two doors for it: one entrance and one as an exit. They made steps for it and a canopy of iron for each door. Al-Ka‘bah had no covering. Ibrahim left when the House was complete and Isma‘il stayed. When people came to him, he saw a woman from Himyar. He liked her beauty and asked Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, to give her to him in marriage. She was already married, but Allah caused him (her husband) to die and she stayed in Makkah in sadness for the death of her husband. Allah granted her solace for the death of her husband and Isma‘il married her. When Ibrahim came for Hajj, she was a perfect woman. Isma‘il went to al-Ta’if to find food for his family. She, on the other hand, saw an old man who asked her about their condition and she informed him of their good condition. He then asked her especially about him. She informed him that he was a man of good religion. He then asked her, ‘Who are you?’ She replied, ‘I am a woman from Himyar.’ Ibrahim then left without meeting Isma‘il and he wrote a letter in which he said, “You must give this letter to your husband when he comes, if Allah so wills.” Isma‘il then returned to her and she gave the letter to him. He read it and asked, ‘Do you know who this old man is?’ She replied, ‘I found him beautiful. He resembled you.’ He said, ‘He is Ibrahim.’ She then said, ‘Woe is me!’ He asked, ‘Why do you say that, did he look at your beauty?’ She replied, ‘No, but I am afraid of my shortcomings toward him.’ She said it to him, and she was an intelligent woman, ‘Allow us to hang curtains over these doors, one here and one there.’ He responded positively. They prepared two curtains, each twelve yards long and hanged them over the doors and he liked them. She then said, ‘Why do I not weave clothes for al- Ka‘bah as a covering to cover it altogether; these stones look rough.’ Isma‘il said to her, ‘That is good.’ She began to work immediately and sent to her people for a large amount of wool to spin for her. “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Woman’s spinning for each other is from that time.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She worked quickly and sought help for this matter. As soon as she prepared a piece, she hanged it on the wall, but by the time of Hajj certain faces of the wall of al-Ka‘bah remained without cover. She then asked Isma‘il, ‘What should we do about this part that is not covered?’ They covered it with fibers of dates. At the time of Hajj, Arabs came to him and found something that was not there before, but they liked when they saw it. They said, ‘Something should be given to the keeper of this house. Each group of Arabs brought something, like leaves and other things, until a great deal was collected with them. They then removed the fibers, completed the covering for the walls and hanged the doors in place. Al-Ka‘bah did not have any roof so Isma‘il prepared pillars like the ones that you see from wood. Isma‘il made the roof with boards and leveled it with clay. Arabs came from places around it, entered al-Ka‘bah, saw the building and they said, ‘The keeper of this house should get more offerings.’ Next time they brought more offerings and Isma‘il did not know what to do about them. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent him revelation to slaughter them and feed them to people performing Hajj. He (the Imam) said, ‘Isma‘il then complained before Ibrahim for lack of water. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent revelation that said to Ibrahim to dig a well from which people performing Hajj can get water. He (Jibril) came and dug in the existing well, Zamzam, until water showed up. He (Jibril) then said, ‘O Ibrahim, climb down.’ He did as he was told to do and Jibril climbed down after him. He (Jibril) said, ‘O Ibrahim, dig in four corners of the well and say “In the name of Allah.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘Ibrahim dug in the corner near the House saying, “In the name of Allah” and a fountain gushed. He then dug in the second corner saying, “In the name of Allah” and another fountain gushed forth. He then dug in the third corner saying, “In the name of Allah,” where yet one more fountain gushed out. He thereafter dug in the fourth corner saying, “In the name of Allah” and the fourth fountain gushed forth. Jibril then said to him, “O Ibrahim, drink and pray for your offspring for blessing.” Both Ibrahim and Jibril came out of the well. He (Jibril) asked Ibrahim to leave for Tawaf around the House. This is the water that Allah gives to the offspring of Isma‘il. Ibrahim then left and Isma‘il escorted him until they were out of the sacred area. Ibrahim then left and Isma‘il returned to the sacred area.’” "

Ibrahim and Isma‘il built the House. They did it by doing a certain amount every day until they ended at the place where there is the Black Stone. Abu Ja’far has said that abu Qubays (hill), then called Ibrahim saying, ‘There is something in trust for you with me.’ It gave the Black Stone to him and he placed it in its place. Ibrahim then called people for Hajj saying, ‘O people, I am Ibrahim, the friend of Allah, and Allah commands you to perform Hajj of this House so you must perform Hajj.’ Thus, all those who up to the Day of Judgment perform Hajj answered his call. The first one who answered his call was from Yemen. He (the Imam) said, ‘Ibrahim, his family and children performed Hajj. Those who think that the person to be slaughtered was Ishaq they do so because of this.”’ It is said that abu Basir had heard this Hadith from abu Ja’far and abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhim al-Salam.

He then went to Mina, where he spent the night. The next morning he went to ‘Arafat, where he raised a tent on Namirah near ‘Arafat, where he built a Masjid with white stones. The marks of Ibrahim’s Masjid were traceable until it was included in the Masjid built in Namirah, where the Imam leads salat (prayer) on the ninth of Dhul Hajjah. He said al-Zuhr and ‘Asr salat (prayer) there, then moved to ‘Arafat. He (Jibril) said, ‘This is ‘Arafat. You must learn the rules of the acts of your Hajj and confess your sins.’ For this reason, it is called ‘Arafat (learning and knowing). He then left for al-Muzdalifah (a place to move in), which is called as such because he moved toward it. He stood on al-Mash‘ar al- Haram and Allah commanded him to slaughter his son. He saw there his manners (morality), shapes (physical condition), and felt comfortable with him. When it was morning, he left al-Mash‘ar for Mina. He told the mother of the child to visit the House and kept the child with him. He then said, ‘Son, bring the donkey and the knife so I can offer the offering.’ Aban has said that I asked abu Basir, ‘What did he mean by donkey and knife?’ He replied, ‘He wanted to slaughter him and then load him on the donkey, ready him for burial and then bury him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The boy brought the donkey and knife and asked, ‘Father where is the offering (animal)?’ He replied, ‘Your Lord knows where he is. Son, you by Allah are he. Allah has commanded me to slaughter you, so what do you think about it?’ He replied, ‘Father, do what you are commanded to do and you will soon find me, if Allah so wills, one of those who exercise patience.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When he decided to slaughter him, he said, ‘Cover my face and tie down my legs.’ He said, ‘Son, tying and slaughtering! I will not do both of them together to you.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘He then found the saddle of the donkey. He (Ibrahim ‘Alayhi al-Salam ) then asked him (his son) to lie down on it. He found the knife and placed it on his throat.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘At this time an old man came and asked, “What do you want from this boy?” He replied, “I want to slaughter him.” He then said, “Glory belongs to Allah. This is a child who has not committed any sins, not even for a blinking of an eye, and you slaughter him!” He said, “Yes, but Allah has commanded me to slaughter him.” He said, “In fact your Lord has prohibited you from slaughtering him. In fact Satan has commanded you in your dream to slaughter him.” He then said, “Woe is on you. The word is what you heard. It is He who has made me do what you see I am doing. By Allah, I will not speak to you.” He then decided to slaughter the boy. The old man said, “O Ibrahim, you are an Imam, people follow you. If you slaughter your son, people will slaughter their children. Wait.” He refused to speak to him’” Abu Basir has said that I heard abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say, ‘He made him to lie down near al-Jamarah al-Wusta’. Then he found the knife, placed it on his throat, then raised his head to the sky. Then he leaned on it but Jibril turned its back toward his throat. Ibrahim looked at it and found it backward. Ibrahim turned it on its sharp edge and Jibril turned it backward. He did it many times, then he was called from the left side of al-Khif Masjid, “O Ibrahim, you indeed made your dream to come true,” and he pulled the boy out from beneath him. Jibril fetched the ram from the top of al-Thabir hill and placed it underneath him. The filthy old man went out to find the old woman when she was looking to the House, which was in the middle of the valley. He said, ‘What kind of an old man is he whom I saw in Mina.’ He described him with Ibrahim’s descriptions and she said, ‘He is my husband.’ He then said, ‘I saw a servant with him.’ He described him by the description of her son. She said, ‘He is my son.’ He said, ‘I saw him make the boy lie down and he had the knife in his hand to slaughter the boy.’ She said, ‘This can never happen. I know Ibrahim is the most kindhearted man. How can you find him slaughtering his son?’ He said, ‘By the Lord of the heaven, by the Lord of earth and this House, I certainly saw him make him lie down with the knife in his hand to slaughter him.’ She asked, ‘Why?’ He replied, ‘He thought his Lord has commanded him to do so.’ She said, ‘He then is right to do so to obey his Lord.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When she completed the acts of Hajj she felt severely moved because of the thought that something may have happened to her son. As if I can see her in the valley moving fast with her hand on her head and saying, “O Lord, do not punish me for what I did to the mother of Isma‘il.” He (the Imam) said, ‘When Sarah came and she was informed of the news, she stood up to her son and looked and found the marks of knife on his throat. She was horrified, complained, and that was the beginning of her illness which caused her death.”’ "

Ali ibn Ibrahim and others have narrated through various chains of narrators have narrated in a marfu‘ manner the following: “They have said that Quraysh had demolished al-Ka‘bah because of flood that would come from the upper part of Makkah and enter al-Ka‘bah. Damages would take place and a deer made of gold with its legs made of diamond was stolen. The walls were not high enough. This happened thirty years before Allah commanded His prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, to rise. Quraysh wanted to demolish al-Ka‘bah to rebuild and increase the size of its floor, but they were afraid of the coming of misfortune upon them because of using spades and shovels to dig. Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah said, ‘Allow me to try. If Allah is happy I will not be hurt; otherwise we will stop the work.’ He climbed on al-Ka‘bah and moved a stone there, a serpent came upon him, and the sun became dark. When they saw this, they cried and pleaded, saying, ‘O Lord, we only want to repair.’ The serpent disappeared; they demolished and removed the stones until they could see the foundations that Ibrahim had set. When they wanted to increase the size of its floor and moved the foundations that Ibrahim had put in place, a severe earthquake took place with darkness. They then gave up on the idea of increasing its floor. The length of the foundation that Ibrahim had set was thirty yards, its width twenty-two yards and its height nine yards. Quraysh wanted to increase its height. When the walls reached up to the Black Stone, they disagreed about setting it in place. Each tribe said that it had the right to set it in place. When the disagreement increased, they then decided to settle their disagreement by the first person entering through the door of banu Shaybah. The Messenger of Allah appeared to them through that door and they said, ‘This is al-Amin (most trusted person) coming to you.’ They asked him to decide the case; he then spread his gown, and someone said, ‘It is a Taruniy’ (name of a particular fabric). He placed the Black Stone on it and said, ‘One person from each Rab‘ (block of city) should come forward.’ The people who came forward were, ‘Utbah ibn Rabi‘ah ibn ‘Abd al- Shams, al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib from banu Asad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Uzza’, abu Hudhayfah ibn al-Mughirah from banu Makhzum and Qays ibn ‘Adiy from banu Sahm. They lifted up the Black Stone and the Holy Prophet set it in its place. On the other hand, the king of Rome had sent a ship with building material and builders to Ethiopia to built a temple for him there. The wind had blown the ship to the shore where it had run aground. Quraysh learned about it. They went to the shore and found certain materials useful for al-Ka‘bah, like wood, decorative materials and other things. They bought them and brought them to Makkah. The length of the wood was of the same measure as needed except al-Hijr. When they built it, they covered it with al-Wasa’id (a certain kind of fabric) which were in gowns.” "

When Qusay dominated Khuza‘ah, they did not know where Zamzam was, so it remained unknown to them. When ‘Abd al-Muttalib became dominant, furnishings for him were arranged in the shadow of the walls of al-Ka‘bah, and this was not done for anyone before. Once, when he was sleeping in the shadow of al-Ka‘bah, he saw in his dream that someone came and said to him, ‘Dig ‘Barrah.’ He asked, ‘What is Barrah?’ Next day he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Taybah.’ On the third day, he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Al-Masunah.’ He asked what is al-Masunah?’ Then on the fourth day, he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Zamzam,’ which will not dry up and will not be disliked. Great people performing Hajj will drink thereby near the red-footed crows that land near the colony of ants.’ There was a rock near Zamzam, on which red-footed crows would land every day to pick up ants for food. The ants had their colony under the rock near Zamzam. When ‘ Abd al-Muttalib saw this, he recognized the place of Zamzam. He then said to Quraysh, ‘I am told in four nights in my dream to dig Zamzam. It is our heritage and an honor for us; come, so we together dig the well.’ They declined his call and he himself began to dig the well and his only son, al-Harith, helped him in the digging. When digging became difficult, he moved to the door of al-Ka‘bah, raised his hands, pleaded before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and made a vow. In his vow he had said that if Allah will give him ten sons, he will offer the most beloved one among them as a sacrificial offering as an act of moving closer to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. When he in his digging reached the walls of the well built by Isma‘il, he came to know of his reaching the water. He said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) and Quraysh also said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), saying, ‘O abu al-Harith, this is of our heritage and we have a share in it.’ He replied, ‘You did not help me, so you do not have any share in it, and it is for me and my children forever.’” "

He could not bend himself down and his son, al-Harith, moved out of the well. He then dug until he found in the bottom of the well a fountain with the fragrance of musk. He then dug about a yard and sleep overcame him, so in his dream he saw a man with long hands, good looking hairs, beautiful face, fine dress and fragrance who was saying, “Dig, you will gain; work hard; you will be safe; and do not store it for distribution. The swords are for people other than you but the well is for you, the greatest of Arabs in honor, and from you will be the Prophet and people with Divine Authority, for the Arabs, as well as the noble ones; men of wisdom, great learning and great intelligent grandsons. The swords are for them and they are not today from you and not for you. However, in the next century from your time, Allah will brighten the land, expel Satans from its diameters, bring them low by its majesty, destroy it after its being strong, bring the idols low, eliminate the idol worshippers wherever they are found. Thereafter will remain a generation from your descendants who will be his brother and vizier, younger than him but powerful over the idols, who will not disobey him, not even one letter, or hide anything from him and will consult him in every matter that faces him.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib felt tired and he found thirteen swords leaned against one side of the well. He took them and decided to spread the matter. He (‘Abd al-Muttalib) then said to himself, “Why should I do this when I have not yet reached the water?” He then dug and after digging only about one foot, the horn of a deer appeared, as well as its head. He took it out and on it this was printed: “No one except Allah deserves worship and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, Ali is empowered with Authority of Allah and so and so is the deputy of Allah on earth.’” I (the narrator) then asked him, ‘The ‘so and so,’ when was he? Was he before or after him?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘He has not come yet, nor anything preliminary to his coming has yet come into existence.’ ‘Abd al-Muttalib then came out of the well with water coming after him and he encountered a black serpent with a long tail move before him quickly upward. He hit and cut most of its tail and then searched to find it but it disappeared. However, so and so is the one to eliminate it, if Allah so wills. It was of the decision of ‘Abd al-Muttalib to place the swords inside al- Ka‘bah against the walls to invalidate his dream in the well. Then Allah made sleep to overcome ‘ Abd al-Muttalib near al-Ka‘bah and he saw the same man in his dream who said, “O Shaybatu al-Hamd, praise your Lord; He will make you the tongue of the earth. Quraysh will follow you for fear, apprehension and for their greedy interest. Keep the swords in their place.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib woke up and answered him, saying, “He will come in dream; if he is from my Lord, it will be very beloved to me, but if it is from Satan, then I think it will be a tailless one.” He did not see anything and did not hear anything. When it was night he came in his dream with a number of men and children who said, “We are the followers of your children; we are the inhabitants of the sixth heaven. The sword is not for you. Marry in Makhzum people, you will be strong, work among Arabs. If you did not have money you have good relationships, so give these thirteen swords to the child from Makhzumiy people and no more than this will appear to you. One out of these swords is for you. It will fall off from your hand. You will not find any trace of it except that so and so mountain hides it. It then will be one of the preliminary issues prior to the rise of al-Qa’im, from the family of Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, with divine authority.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib then woke up and left with the swords on his shoulder. He then went to a corner of the corners of Makkah and he lost one sword. It was the finest to him. It will appear from that place. He then entered Mu‘tamar (prepared to perform ‘Umrah), performed Tawaf around it, with it (swords) on his shoulder and the two deer, he made twenty-one Tawaf while Quraysh was looking at him; when he said, “O Allah, make your promise to come true, thus, establish my word, spread the word about me, strengthen my arms.” These were his repeated words. After his dream in the well, he did not do any Tawaf, while saying lines of poetry until he died. However, he spontaneously read a poem to his sons on the day he wanted to offer ‘Abd Allah, one of his sons, as a sacrificial offering. He gave all the swords to banu al-Makhzumiyah to al-Zubayr, to abu Talib, to ‘Abd Allah. Four of them went to abu Talib. One sword for abu Talib, one sword for Ali, one sword for Ja‘far, one sword for Talib, and for Zubayr there were two swords. For ‘Abd Allah there were two swords, then it returned and Ali had four swords. Of the rest, two were of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, and two of her children. The sword of Ja’far fell off on the day he got hurt and no one knows in whose hand is it now. We say no one of our swords fell in the hands of one who is not one of us, except the man who helps us with it, but that it turns into charcoal.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘One of them is in the (special) location. It will come out like a serpent and an arm will appear from it or something similar to it. It will shine the earth many times, and then disappear, and then when it is night, it will do the same thing again. This is its manner until its owner comes. If I want I can give his name but I am afraid for you if I name him and then you will give his name, which then will be ascribed to one who is other than him.’” "

When people wanted to come to His House, He made them stand, wait at the door and appeal for permission.’ It was asked from him, ‘Why is al-Mash‘ar al-Haram part of al-Haram?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It is because when permission was given to come, He made them to stop on the second barrier but when their pleading prolonged, permission was granted to them to move their offerings closer. When they cleaned themselves with it, they became clean of sins, which were as barriers between them, and He granted permission to visit (His House) in a clean condition.’ It was then asked, ‘Why is fasting during the bright days not permissible?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It is because people are Allah’s visitors, they are His guests and it is not nice for a host that his guests remain fasting.’ He was asked, ‘Why should one hold to the curtains of al-Ka‘bah and what does it mean?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It is like one who has committed a crime against another person; thus he holds to his clothes and expresses humility before him to forgive him his sins and crime.’” "

People of al-Madinah, people of al-‘Awaliy and Arabs all came together for Hajj of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. They only followed the Messenger of Allah and waited for his orders or did what the Messenger of Allah did. The Messenger of Allah left for Makkah just four days before the beginning of the month of Dhu al-Hajj ah. When he arrived at Dhu al-Hulayfah it was noontime, the sun had just declined to the west from a point half way between east and west overhead. He took a shower, and then went to the Masjid near the tree. He performed al-Zuhr salat (prayer), and then made his decision to perform an individual (Ifrad) Hajj. He then left and arrived at al-Bayda’, one mile away from al-Madinah, where two rows of people stood in line. He said Talbiyah (here I am O Lord, to obey Your command). He herded his offering animals that numbered sixty-six or sixty-four heads of cattle. He then arrived in Makkah during the end of the fourth day of Dhu al-Hajj. He performed seven times Tawaf around the House, performed two Rak‘at salat (prayer) behind the station of Ibrahim, returned to the Black Stone and touched it. He had touched it in the beginning of his Tawaf walking around the House. He then said, ‘Al-Safa’ and al-Marwah are of al-Sha’a’ir of Allah (things that remind one of Allah). So I begin with what Allah, the most High, has begun with.’ The Muslims thought that al-Sa‘y (walking) between al-Safa’ al-Marwah was something that the pagans did. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then revealed this, ‘Al-Safa’ and al-Marwah are of al-Sha’a’ir of Allah (things that remind one of Allah). Those who perform Hajj or ‘Umrah must perform Tawaf between them.’ ( 2 : 153 ) “He then went to al-Safa’, climbed it, turned his face to the al-Yemaniy corner (of the House), thanked and praised Allah, and prayed for as long as it may take one to read Chapter two of the Holy Quran, in fluent reading. He then climbed down toward al-Marwah and stood on it just as he had done on al- Safa’ . He then climbed down and returned to al-Safa’ where he stood for a while, then came down toward al-Marwah (and so on) until he completed seven times of walking between the two places. When he completed his Sa‘y while on al-Marwah, he turned toward people, praised Allah, spoke of His glory and then said, ‘This is Jibril. He pointed with his hand to a point behind him. He commands me to command those who have not herded their sacrificial animals to come out of the state of Ihram. In future, I will not do what I have done this time (performing Ifrad Hajj and herding sacrificial animals). Instead, I will do what I am commanding you to do, but I have herded my sacrificial animals and it is not proper for one who has herded his sacrificial animals to come out of the state of Ihram (at this point) before the sacrificial animals reach their place.’ He (the Imam) said that a man from the group then said to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, ‘Must we then begin performing the acts of Hajj while water from our heads and hairs is dropping down (after taking a shower for carnal relations)?’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, then said to him, ‘You, however, will never believe in it.’ Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Jush‘am al-Kinaniy then said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach us our religion as if we are just created today. Is what you do for this year only, or it is for future also?’ The Messenger of Allah replied, ‘It certainly is forever to the Day of Judgment.’ He then grappled the fingers of one of his hands with those of the other hand saying, ‘A1-’ Umrah with Hajj are joined together up to the Day of Judgment.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then arrived in Makkah in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, from Yemen. He went to Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, when she had come out of the state of Ihram. He found her using perfume and dressed in colored clothes. He then asked, ‘Why have you done this, O Fatimah?’ She replied, ‘The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, commanded us to do so.’ Ali, Alayhi al-Salam, then went to the Messenger of Allah to find out a fatwa saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Fatimah has come out of the state of Ihram and has dressed up in colored clothes.’ The Messenger of Allah replied, ‘I have commanded people to do so. O Ali, how have you commenced your Hajj?’ He replied, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have said, “My commencement of Hajj is like that of the Holy Prophet.” The Messenger of Allah then said, ‘You must remain with your Ihram as I have remained and you are my partner in my sacrificial animals.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The Messenger of Allah arrived in Makkah, at al-Batha’ along with his companions. They did not use the houses. On the day of al-Tarwiyah (eighth of Dhu al-Hajjah) at noontime, he (the Messenger of Allah) commanded people to take a shower, say Talbiyah (here I am O Lord, to obey Your command) for Hajj. These are the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, that He revealed to His Prophet, ‘Follow the religion of (your father) Ibrahim.’ (3:89) The Messenger of Allah and his companions came out for Hajj saying Talbiyah (here I am O Lord, to obey Your command) until they arrived in Mina, where they said salat (prayer) of al-Zuhr, al-‘Asr, al-Maghrib, al-Tsha’a and al-Fajr. In the morning, people were with him. Quraysh would leave from al-Muzdalifah, which is al-JanT, and would prevent people to leave from that place. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, came and Quraysh hoped that his leaving would be like their leaving from al-Muzdalifah. Allah, most High, then revealed this verse. ’Then you must leave (al-Muzdalifah) as people do and ask Allah for His forgiveness’ (2:198), meaning thereby, Ibrahim, Isma’il and Ishaq in their departure from it and those after them. When Quraysh saw the banner of the Messenger of Allah had passed, they felt something in their heart about leaving from their place. It (the banner) arrived at al-Namirah, which is Batn ‘ Arnah, parallel to Arak. The banner was raised and people pitched their tents there. When it was noontime, the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, came out. Quraysh also did so, along with him. He had taken a shower and had discontinued saying Talbiyah (here I am O Lord, to obey Your command). He stood at the door of the Masjid, preached to people of His commands and prohibitions. He then said salat (prayer) of al-Zuhr and al-’Asr with one Adhan and two Tqamah. He then went to the staying place and remained there. People began crowding around his camel. He moved his camel and they also did so. He then said, £ 0 people, the staying place is not under the feet of my camel only. This whole area’ - pointing with his hand to station - ’is the place to stay’. People then scattered around. He did the same thing in al-Muzdalifah and people stayed there until sunset, then he left and commanded people to remain calm and peaceful until they arrived in al- Muzdalifah, which is al-Mash‘ar al-Haram. He said salat (prayer) of al-Maghrib and al-‘Isha’ prayers with one Adhan and two Tqamah, then he stayed until he said salat (prayer) of al-Fajr there and asked the weaker people of banu Hashim to leave quickly during the night and not to throw pebbles on al- Jamarah (Jamarah al-‘Aqabah) before sunrise. When the day became bright, he left al-Muzdalifah. He arrived in Mina. He then threw pebbles on Jamarah al-‘Aqabah. The sacrificial animals that the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, had brought were sixty-four or sixty-six heads. Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, had brought thirty-four heads or thirty-six heads of cattle. The Messenger of Allah offered sixty-six heads of cattle and Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, offered thirty-four heads of cattle. “The Messenger of Allah commanded him to take from the meat of every camel a piece and cook it in a pot. The Messenger of Allah and Ali, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, ate from the meat and sipped of the soup thereof. They did not give the hide or the items with which the animals were herded or decorated to the butchers. Instead, such items were given as charity to the needy. He shaved his head, visited the House, returned to Mina and stayed there until the bright days were over. He threw pebbles on al- Jamar and left until he arrived in al-Abtah. ‘A’ishah then asked, ’O Messenger of Allah, are you returning your wives with Hajj and ‘Umrah together and only I return with Hajj?’ He then stayed in al- Abtah and sent ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn abu Bakr with her to al-Tan‘im. She said Talbiyah (here I am O Lord, to obey Your command) for ‘Umrah from there and came for Tawaf around the House, to pray two Rak’at prayers near the station of Ibrahim, made Sa’y between al-Safa’ and al-Marwah, then came to the Holy Prophet. He (the Messenger of Allah) left the same day, did not enter al-Masjid al-Haram and did not perform Tawaf around the House. He entered from the upper part of Makkah from ‘Aqabah al-Madaniyin and came out from the lower part of Makkah from Dhu Tuwa’.” "

When he (the Messenger of Allah) arrived at al-Shajarah, he performed Salat (prayer) then drove his stumper until he arrived in al-Bayda’, he then assumed the state of Ihram and recited Talbiyah for al- Hajj. He (the Messenger of Allah) drove one hundred camels and all the people also assumed the state of Ihram for al-Hajj. They did not have the intention for al-‘Umrah and did not know what al-Mut‘ah was. When the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, arrived in Makkah he performed Tawaf around the House.

He (the Messenger of Allah) then performed Tawaf between al-Safa’ and al-Marwah seven times. When he (the Messenger of Allah) completed his Tawaf at al-Marwah, he (the Messenger of Allah) then stood there for a speech. He (the Messenger of Allah) commanded them to come out of the state of Ihram and make it an al-‘Umrah. It is something that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has commanded to do. People came out of the state of Ihram and the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, said, Tf I will have a chance in future I will not go back. I will do as I have commanded you to do. He (the Messenger of Allah) was not able to come out of the state of Ihram because of the offering animals, which were with him (the Messenger of Allah). Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says, ‘Do not shave your heads until the offering animals reach their designated places.’ Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Jush‘am al-Kinaniy said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach us just as we are created today. What you have commanded us to do this year is it just for this year or it will be as such every year?’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, said, ‘It is forever.’ A man stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah is it that we will come to perform al-Hajj and water will drip from our heads?’ (He thereby meant engagement in sexual activities). The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, said, ‘You will never believe in it (al-Mut‘ah of al-Hajj). He (the Imam) said that Ali ‘Alayhi al-Salam, arrived from Yeman to perform al-Hajj, he found Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, who had come out of the state of Ihram, and he sensed perfumes. He (the Imam) went to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, for a fatwa. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, asked, ‘What kind of intention did you have?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘I made my intention like the intention of the Holy prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘You must not come out of the state of Hiram.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) allowed him (the Imam) to share his offering animals and gave him (the Imam) thirty-seven. The Messenger of Allah slaughtered sixty- three. He (the Messenger of Allah) slaughtered them with his own hands. He (the Messenger of Allah) then from every camel took a certain amount of meat and placed it in one cooking pot. He then commanded to cook, then ate from the meat and sipped from the broth. He (the Messenger of Allah) then said, ‘Now we all have used the meat of our offering for food. Having al-Mut‘ah (advantage of coming out of the state of Ihram after completing the acts of ‘Umrah) is better than al-Qiran Hajj, in which one herds his offering cattle as well as performs Hajj in the form of al-Mufrad Hajj.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘Did the Messenger of Allah enter the state of Ihram during the night or during the day?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It was during the day.’ I then asked, ‘In which hour of the day was it?’ He (the Imam) replied it was at the time of the Salat (prayer) at noontime.’” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘You must perform al-Hajj al-Tamattu‘ (advantageous).’ When they left I went to see him (the Imam) and said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, if you do not tell them what you have told to Zurarah, we will go to al- Kufah and will prove him a liar. He (the Imam) said, ‘Call them back. They came back and he (the Imam) said, ‘What Zurarah has said is true.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘By Allah, from this day on no one will hear this from me.’” "

O Allah, provide for me a shadow under the shadow of Your Throne on the day when there is no shadow except Your shadow.” Entrust your religion with the Lord very often, as well as yourself and family. Then say, “I entrust Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful who does not allow what He is entrusted with to become lost. I entrust Him with my life, my religion and family. O Allah, make me useful in the service of Your book and the tradition of Your Prophet. Make me die in Your religion and protect me against mischief.” Then say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), three times. Then say it twice and then once. Then repeat it all over again. If you cannot do so, do it only partially.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, that the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, would keep praying at al-Safa’ for as long as one can complete reading all of Chapter two of the Holy Quran.’” "

O Allah, do not plan against me, or prepare slippery conditions and do not lead me gradually to destruction. You listen to appeals better than all of those who listen.

I appeal before You O Allah, to grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause), make so and so of my wishes to come true.” Of the prayer you may say should be this when you raise your hands to the sky, “O Allah, my wishes are such ones that if You grant them, whatever You deny will not harm me and if You deny whatever You have granted me will not benefit me. I appeal before You to set me free from hellfire. O Allah, I am Your servant, of the things that You own and the control of my forehead is in Your hand, and You know the time of my death.

However, forgiveness for them is of three kinds. There is forgiveness in favor of a believer of his past and future sins and his freedom from fire as is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Lord, grant us goodness in this word, grant us goodness in the next life and protect us against the torment of the fire. These will have a share of what they have done and Allah is quick in accounting.” (2:200-201) There are those of them whose past sins Allah forgives. He has said, “Do good in the rest of your life.” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Those of them who leave earlier during the two days have not committed any sins. Those who leave after the two days also have not committed any sins,” (2:203) meaning those who die before leaving have not committed any sins and those who leave later have not committed any sins if they maintain piety in the matters of major sins. Muslims in general (non-Shi`a) say, “Those who leave during the two days have not committed any sins, meaning leaving Mina’ with the first departing people, and those who leave later have not committed any sins, meaning they have not committed any sins if they maintain piety in the matter of hunting.” Do you think Allah prohibits hunting after making it lawful as is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “When you are free of the restrictions of Ihram you may hunt.” (5:3) It is in the interpretations of non-Shi`a Muslims that when you are free of the restrictions of Ihram you must not hunt. “There is the unbeliever who has attended al-Mawqaf (station of the pilgrims) for worldly reasons. Allah forgives his past sins, if he repents from the sin of paganism for his future. He will receive his reward and he will not be left hopeless of the reward of his staying at this station if he does not commit any sins.

I testify that you are the words of piety, the gateway of guidance, the unbreakable safety ring, the authority of Allah over the living and those under the earth. I testify that such qualities existed with you in the past and they are means of victory and triumph in future. I testify that your spirits and your clay (substance of your bodies) are clean, pure and cleansed. The substances of you (’A’immah) bodies were one from the other. It was a favor and great kindness for us from Allah. I designate Allah as my witness and I designate you as my witness that I believe in your (divine authority), I am your follower in my soul, in the rules of my religion, in the consequences of my deeds, in my return and my place of rest. I appeal before Allah, Honorable and Merciful to complete it for me. I testify that you accomplished all that Allah had commanded you to do and in so doing you were not afraid of anyone other than Allah. You strove hard for His cause, worshipped Him until the time of your death. I appeal before Allah to condemn those who murdered you, those who commanded your murderer and those condoned with the plan of your murderers. I testify that the statements of the Holy Prophet condemned those who violated your sanctity and spilled your blood.’ “Thereafter say, ‘O Allah, condemn those who have misrepresented Your bounty, opposed Your institution, turned away from Your command, accused Your messenger and created obstacles in Your path. O Allah, fill their graves with fire as well as their bellies and drive them and their followers to hell with their eyes turned blue. O Allah, condemn them with such condemnation with which the prominent angels, every messenger-prophet and every believing person whose faith is tested for its strength will condemn. O Allah, condemn them in most secrecy and concealment as well as openly in public manner. O Allah, condemn Jawabit (pi. of Jibt, devil) of this nation as well as its Tawaghit (pi. of taghut, transgressors), condemn its Pharaohs, condemn the murderers of ’Amir al-Mu’minin, the murderers of al-Husayn and punish them with such punishment which no one in the world is punished with. O Allah, make us of those who support him, of those whom You use for support and You grant them Your support for the cause of Your religion in this world as well as in the next world.’ “Then sit down near his head and say, I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of Your services to His cause). I testify that you are a servant of Allah, His trustee who has accomplished with wisdom the task of trustworthiness, spoke as truthful person and passed away with certainty. You did not accept blindness in place of guidance and never deviated from truth to falsehood. I testify that you performed salat (prayer), paid zakat, commanded people to do good and forbade them from doing evil deeds, followed the Messenger, recited the book in the true way of recitation and called people to the path of your Lord with wisdom and good advice. I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of Your services to His cause), with safety and protection. I appeal before Allah to reward you as with the reward of a truthful one’s good rewards for his services to his people. I testify that Jihad (striving for the cause of Allah) in your support is the true Jihad. I testify that truth is on your side, it belongs to you, you are of the people of truth, the source of truth and that the legacy of prophet-hood is with you and with the people of your family. I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of Your services to His cause), with peace and protection. I testify that you are Allah’s truthful servant and His authority over his creatures. I testify that your call is truthful call and every caller appointed beside you is false and invalid. I testify that Allah is the clear truth.’ “Thereafter you should go toward his feet and pray for yourself as you may choose. ‘Then you should go toward the head of Ali ibn al-Husayn and say, ‘I appeal before Allah to grant you His protection and peace and the greeting of peace of His prominent angels and prophets who were sent as messengers. You are my master and the son of my master. I appeal before Allah to bless you with His kindness and blessings. I appeal before Allah to grant compensation and reward to you, your family and the offspring of your noble and chosen ancestors from whom Allah has decided to remove all rijs (all filthy matters) and purify in a through purification.’ “Thereafter you should go to the gravesites of the martyrs and offer them your greetings of peace and say, I appeal before Allah to grant you peace and protection, O believers in the Lord, you have proceeded and we follow you. We are your followers and supporters. I testify that you are supporters of Allah, the masters of the martyrs in this world and in the next life. You are supporters of Allah as Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “There were many prophets on whose side people believing in the Lord were fighting. They did not show any lack of responsibility even though they were hurt for the cause of Allah, nor showed any weakness or compromise with the enemy.” (3:146) You indeed did not show any weakness or compromise with the enemy, until you went before Allah on the path of the truth, supporting the perfect words of Allah. I appeal before Allah to grant favors and compensation to your spirits and bodies worthy of your services to His cause, with peace and protection. There is good news for you through the promise of Allah, which does not change, because He does not change His promises. Allah will accomplish His granting what He has promised to you, the masters of the martyrs, in this world and in the next life. You are the first al-Muhajirun (immigrants (to Allah)) and al- Ansar (the helpers). I testify that you did Jihad (strove hard) for the cause of Allah and you were murdered while protecting the institution of the Messenger of Allah and the son (the child) of the Messenger of Allah, I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause) with peace and protection. All praise belongs to Allah who made His promise with you to come true and showed you what you loved.’ “Then return to the gravesite and say, ‘I have come to you, O beloved of the Messenger of Allah, the son (child) of the Messenger of Allah. I am aware of your status and I acknowledge your rights. I am aware of your merits and the straying of those who opposed you. I have knowledge of the guidance you follow. I pray to Allah to keep my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause. O Allah, I appeal before You to grant salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of Your services to His cause) just as You have granted favors and compensation worthy of his services to Your cause, and as Your messenger and ’Amir al-Mu’minin have appealed before You to grant compensation to him worthy of his services to Your cause. Grant him a continuous salat, connected, substituted one, following the other without break in time or point of time at this time and when we are here or not here. (I hereby declare, affirm and acknowledge that you are a ‘Alayhi al-Salam and my) submission to (your commandments) and appeal before Allah to grant you protection, kindness and blessings’. “When you decide to say farewell to him say, ’(I hereby declare, affirm and acknowledge that you are a ‘Alayhi al-Salam and my) submission to (your commandments) and appeal before Allah to grant you protection and kindness and blessings. I leave you in the protection of Allah and offer you my greeting of peace. We believe in Allah, the Messenger of Allah and in what you have brought and guided to. We have followed the messenger, so list us among the witnesses. O Allah, do not make this the last chance for me to visit him and his seeing us. O Allah, I appeal before You to make us benefit from our love for him. O Allah, raise him to the praiseworthy position whereby You support through him Your religion, eliminate Your enemies, destroy those who commence a war against the family of Muhammad, ‘Alayhi al-Salam; You have promised so and You do not change Your promise. (I hereby declare, affirm and acknowledge that you are a ‘Alayhi al-Salam and my) submission to (your commandments and I appeal before Allah to grant you protection, kindness and blessings. I testify that you are noble martyrs who strove hard for the cause of Allah and were murdered while protecting the institution of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause) with protection and safety a great deal.’” "

Among us Yunus, who was the eldest did the speaking and he said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I sometimes attend the meeting of these people, meaning children of al-‘Abbas, what should I say?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When you are in their meeting and you speak of us then say, “O Allah, show us comfort and happiness,” in saying this you come up with what you want.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I very often speak of al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, what I should say?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Say, ‘Sala’ Allah ‘Alayka O abu ‘Abd Allah, I appeal before Allah to grant you salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of Your services to His cause), three times. Al-Salam reaches him from nearby as well as distant places.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘When abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, passed away, the seven heavens and the seven earths wept. Everything between them, those who move in paradise and in hell, all that our Creator has created, all that can be seen and those that cannot be seen wept for abu ‘Abd Allah, al-Husayn ‘Alayhi al-Salam. Only three things did not weep.’ I then asked, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, what are these three things?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Things that did not weep were al-Basrah, Damascus and Ale ‘Uthman who did not weep, may Allah’s condemnation be upon them.’ I then said, ‘I want to visit him. What should I do?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When you want to visit abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, take a bath in al- Furat canal, then dress up in clean cloths, walk bare-foot; you are in a sacred location of Allah and the sacred locations of His Messenger. You must say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), Tahlil (no one deserves worship except Allah). Tasbih, (Allah is free of all defects), Tahmid (all praise belongs to Allah) and Ta‘zim (Allah the most great is free of all defects) of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, a great deal as well as saying, O Allah, grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause). When you arrive at the door of al- Hayr then say, ‘(I hereby declare, affirm and acknowledge that you are a ‘Alayhi al-Salam and my) submission to (your commandments) O the one who possesses authority from Allah, and son of the one who possesses authority from Allah. I offer greeting of peace to you, O angels of Allah, and visitors of the gravesite of the grandchild of the prophet of Allah.’ Then take ten steps forward, then stand up and say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) thirty times.

(I hereby declare, affirm and acknowledge that you are a ‘Alayhi al-Salam and my) submission to (your commandments) O Watru (the oppressed one who belong to the side of Allah) Allah al-Mawtur in heavens and on earth. I testify that your blood lives in eternity because of which the shadows of the Throne shudder, for which all creatures in all seven heavens, seven earths, all that is between them, all that moves in paradise and in hell of the creatures of our Lord, things that can be seen and those that cannot be seen weep. I testify that you possess authority from Allah and you are the son of one who possesses authority from Allah. I testify that you were murdered and your father was murdered as well. I testify that you are Tha’ra Allah son of Tha’ra Allah. I testify that you are watru Allah al-Mawtur in the heaves and on earth.

Through you the trees yield their fruits. Through you Allah sends down rain and sustenance from the sky. Through you Allah removes hardship and through you Allah sends down heavy rain.

All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds. I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to you worthy of your services to His cause), O abu ‘ Abd Allah.

I was told to come in. When I went inside, I found him in his place for salat (prayer) in his house. I then sat down until he completed his salat (prayer). I then heard him secretly speaking to his Lord. ‘O the One who has granted us honor in a special way, O the one who has granted us exclusive executorships of the will of the messengers and has promised us intercession, granted us the knowledge of the past and future and has made the hearts of people to incline toward us, forgive me and my brothers (in belief). (O Lord, forgive) the visitors of the grave of abu ‘Abd Allah, al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, who spend their wealth. Those who ready their bodies due to their interest in doing good to us and because of their hope in what is with You of compensation for keeping good relations with us and because of the happiness they bring to the heart of Your prophet. I appeal before Allah to grant salawat (favors and compensation to Your Holy prophet and his family worthy of his services to Your cause) and forgive them because of their yielding to our commands and because of the anger due to their visit they cause to our enemies. In doing so, they only want to find that You are happy with them. So compensate them on our behalf by being happy with them, and support them in the night and day. Be their deputy in their families and children whom they have left behind, as best deputy. Accompany them and protect them against the evil of every hostile tyrant, weak ones of Your creatures or strong ones, and against the evil of the devils of humankind and al-Jinn. Grant them the best, which they are to receive from You in their condition of being in strange places away from their homes and because of the preference they have given to us over their own children, families and relatives. O Allah, our enemies mock at them for their visiting us, but this does not prevent them from setting on their journey toward us and from opposing those who oppose us. So be kind to the faces, which the heat of sun has changed. Be kind to the side of those faces, which are turned from side to side over the grave of abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. Be kind to those eyes, which have shed tears in sympathy with us. Be kind to the hearts, which mourned and felt pain for us. Be kind to the wailing cries for us. O Allah, I entrust those souls and bodies with You until the time we meet, and compensate them at the pond (in paradise) on the dehydrating day.’ He (the Imam) continued with such prayers in a prostrating position. When he completed, I said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, if what I heard from you were for even those who do not know Allah, I think, hellfire would not touch them. I by Allah, wished to have visited the grave of al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, instead of performing al-Hajj.’ He (the Imam) said to me, ‘He is much closer to you. What then prevents you from visiting him?’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘O Mu‘awiyah, why do you neglect such visitations?’ I said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I did not know the matter is of all such great degrees of significance.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘O Mu‘awiyah, the number of those who pray for the visitors of al- Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, in the heavens is much greater than those who pray for them on earth.’” "
