He inspires the womb to open its door so that His creature can enter in it and His authoritative determination and measure. The womb opens its door and the seed reaches the womb, then turns back and forth for forty days, then it becomes a clot, then an embryo in forty days, then a piece of flesh in which veins spread like a net. Then Allah sends two creative angels in the womb who make in the womb as Allah wills. They enter inside the woman through her mouth until they reach her womb. In it (the seed) is the old spirit transferred from the backs of men to the wombs of women, then they blow in it the spirit of life and continued life and carve for him ears, eyes, all of his parts and all the inside by the permission of Allah. Then Allah sends revelation to the two angels that says, ‘Write upon him My authoritative command of determination and measures and stipulate for me a change of plan (al- bada’) in what you write.’ They then ask, ‘What must we write, O Lord?’ Allah then reveals to them to raise their heads to the head of his mother.’ They then raise their heads and find a tablet knocking [informing] from the forehead of his mother. They look at it and find in it his shape, fashion, duration of his life, his covenant of being a virtuous or a wicked one and all of his characteristics.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘One of them dictates, the other writes all that is in the tablet and stipulates the condition of change of plan (al-bada’). They seal the book and place it between his two eyes, then they make him stand up in the belly of his mother.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He perhaps turns insolent and changes and this only happens with insolent and disobedient ones. When it is time for his coming out Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, inspires the womb to open its door so that His creature can come out to His earth so that His command is applied to him; it is time for him to come out.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘The womb then opens the door of the child and Allah sends an angel called a reprimanding one, who reprimands him and it makes him feel shocked. His head turns downward and his feet upward thus Allah makes it easy for the child to come out as well as for the woman.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘When he stops the angel reproaches him again which gives him a shock again.

Inside from her to the womb there are three locks. One lock is for the upper side parallel to the bellybutton from the right side, the other lock is from the midsection and another lock is lower in the womb. After nine days, it is placed in the upper lock where it remains for three months and at this time, the woman experiences disgust and nausea.

Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad has said that narrated to me Hamdan al-Qalanisiy that ‘Umar ibn Shihab al-‘Abdiy asked me, ‘On what basis your people say that divorce pronounced three times does not make it three divorces?’ I said to him, ‘They believe that divorce is based on the book and al -Sunnah and whatever is against them is returned to them.’ He then asked, ‘What do you say about one who has divorced according to the book and Sunnah and his wife goes out or he sends her out and she counts the waiting period somewhere other than her house? Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, “Do not send them out of their house and they must not go out.’” I replied him with an answer, which was not from me. I met Ayyub ibn Nuh, asked him about it and informed him of the words of ‘Umar (ibn Shihab). He said, ‘We do not accept analogy. We only say what texts say.’ I then met Ali ibn Rashid and asked him about it and about the words of ‘Umar (ibn Shihab). He said, ‘He has used analogy against you to bind you. If divorce is not permissible without the book and Sunnah, waiting period also is not accepted without the book and Sunnah .’ I then asked Mu‘awiyah ibn al-Hukaym about it and informed him of the words of ‘Umar (ibn Shihab). Mu‘awiyah said, ‘Waiting period is not like divorce. There is a difference between them. Divorce is the act of divorcee. If he does against the book and against what he is commanded to do we can say to him to return to the book, otherwise, divorce is not valid. The waiting period is not the act of the man or woman. The days pass. Hayd (menses) takes place and it is not her act or his act. It is the act of Allah, most Blessed, most High. The act of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, cannot be analogized with his acts or her acts. If she acts against the law, the waiting period passes, and she has committed a sin in acting against the law. Had the waiting period been her act we would not make it to take place on her like divorce is invalid if it is against the law. “Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan has said, in answer presented by abu ‘Ubayd in the book of divorce that certain people of al-Kalam (theology) has said, ‘When Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, sanctioned divorce with waiting period He did not inform us that whoever divorces without waiting period his divorce is invalid. It is something that men and women obey and do not go out of the house as long as waiting period is not complete. We are only informed about sin. Allah has said, ‘. . . such is the limits set by Allah so do not transgress against them and those who transgress against the limits of Allah has done injustice to himself .’ Is disobedience in divorce like disobedience in waiting period by going out of her house? Do you not say that the nation collectively says that if a divorced woman goes out of her house for days, such days are counted as part of her waiting period even if she has disobeyed Allah? In addition, divorce during Hayd (menses) is counted against divorcee even though he has disobeyed Allah.

He (the Imam) said, ‘Waiting period for a woman divorced three times is passing of three Hayd (menses)- free periods. It is to ascertain a womb is free of child and pregnancy. About the waiting period of a widow Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has set a condition for and a condition against women. In the condition for them He does not hold them accountable and in the condition against them He has not done injustice to them. In the case of ’Ila’ (swearing not to go to bed with one’s wife) it is four months as Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says, ‘. . . for those who swear there is a four month waiting period.’ (2:226) He has not made it permissible for anyone in the case of ‘Ila’ to wait more than four months because He, most Blessed, most High, knows how long women can wait without going to bed and without men. The condition against women is in the case of the death of their husband in which case they must wait for four months and ten days. Thus He has taken from her when he dies as much as He has takes for her from him during his life time in the case of ‘Ila’ as Allah, most Blessed, most High, says, ‘. . . they must wait for four months and ten days.’ He has not mentioned the ten days in waiting period except with four months.

I gave birth to many children for him. I helped him in his world and religion and he has not seen any dislikeable things from me. I complain against him before Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, and before you.” He (the Messenger of Allah) asked, “What is your complaint against him?” She replied, “Today he said to me, ‘You are unlawful for me like the back of my mother is.’ He expelled me from my house, please look into my affairs.” The Messenger of Allah said, “Allah has not sent down any book by which I can decide between you and your husband and I do not like to take the trouble on myself.” She began to weep and complain before Allah and His Messenger and returned. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, heard her conversations with His Messenger, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, about her husband and what she complained about. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent a reading about it: “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Allah has certainly heard the words of the woman who argued with you about her husband and who (after not having received a favorable response from you) complained to Allah. Allah was listening to your argument [meaning the statements of the Messenger of Allah about her husband]. Allah is All hearing and All aware. (58:1) “Those who renounce their wives by calling them to be as their mothers should know that their wives could never become their mothers. Their mothers are those who have given birth to them. The words that they speak are certainly detestable and sinful. However, Allah is Pardoning and All forgiving.” (58:2)’ “The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, sent for her and she came. He (the Messenger of Allah) said to bring her husband before him. She brought her husband. He (the Messenger of Allah) asked, ‘Have you said this to your wife, ‘you are unlawful to me like the back of my mother is?’ He replied, ‘I have said so to her.’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, said, ‘Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has sent verses of al-Quran about you and your wife.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) read for him what Allah had revealed, ‘Allah has heard the words of the woman . . . Allah is Pardoning and All-forgiving.’ (58:2) Hold your wife to yourself because you have said evil and sinful words. Allah has forgiven you and has pardoned you. You must not do such thing again.’ The man returned and he was regretful because of what he had said to his wife. Allah disliked it for the believers thereafter and then He revealed, ‘Those who involve themselves in Zihar against their women then return from what they have said. . .’ meaning when the first man said to his wife, ‘You are unlawful to me like the back of my mother.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Whoever says it after Allah pardoned and forgave the first man, “must set free a slave before touching (going to bed with) his wife. This is how Allah gives advice and Allah is well aware of what you do. If one cannot set free a slave he must fast for two consecutive months before touching each other. If one cannot do this also then he must feed sixty destitute people.” Allah has sanctioned this penalty after He prohibited Zihar and said, “This is done so that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and such are the laws of Allah.” Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has sanctioned this penalty because of Zihar.’” Humran has said that abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Zihar does not take place by swearing, harming and in anger.

In fact He created the creatures and He, most Majestic, most Glorious, knew what their bodies needed and what was beneficial for them; so He made such things lawful for them as a favor to them from Him, most Blessed, most High, for their well being. He knew what was harmful to them, so He prohibited them and made it unlawful to them but then He made lawful for those compelled and in the times when their bodies could not survive without it so He commanded to use it for the bare necessities and not more.’ “He (the Imam) said, ‘The dead animals are unlawful; no one must use it every now and then because it weakens their bodies, makes it thin and his power goes away, his offspring become cutoff and those who eat dead bodies die suddenly. “Blood is unlawful because eating it causes yellow fluid, bad breath, foul smell, bad moral behavior and causes an illness similar to madness, hardheartedness, lack of kindness and sympathy so much so that one may murder his children, and parents, and he cannot be trusted about his best friends and his companions. “The flesh of pigs is unlawful because Allah, most Blessed, most High, metamorphosed certain people in different shapes such as pigs, apes and bears and others. He then prohibited eating such things, it is a kind of cannibalism, so people must not take advantage of such things and must not take consequent suffering lightly. “Wine is made unlawful because of its bad effects and damages it may cause. He (the Imam) then said, ‘One who often uses wine is like a worshipper of idols, it causes tremors, takes away the light (beauty), abolishes kindness, carries him to excessive boldness against the relatives like bloodshed and fornication. He, when drunk cannot be trusted and he may disregard his sanctity when failing to understand. Drinking wine does not increase anything to one except what is worse and evil.’” "

You must notice that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has created creatures in His creation and has made them a barrier over His creation, and they are the pillars on His earth, protectors of His commandments, the noble ones in His knowledge whom He had chosen before His creation, while as shadows on the right of His throne.’ He (the narrator) has said that Qatadah remained silent for a long time, then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep you well, I have sat before scholars of fiqh and before ibn ‘Abbas but my heart did not become nervous before anyone of them as it has become nervous before you.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘Fie upon you, do you realize where are sitting?

Is that egg edible?’ Qatadah said, ‘No, it is not edible and I do not command anyone to eat it.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, asked, ‘Why do you not eat it?’ He replied, ‘Because it is dead.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘If that egg is hatched and it becomes a chicken will you eat the chicken?’ Qatadah replied, ‘Yes, I will do so.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘What is it that makes you to eat the chicken but not the egg from which it has come out?’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘The same rule applies to rennet which is like the egg.

Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, presents our divine authority before waters and that which accepts it becomes sweet and fine, but what rejects it Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, makes it bitter, salty and burning.’” "

Wine became unlawful because of the enemy of Allah, Iblis deceived Eve until he sucked the grape, but if he would eat, grapes would have become unlawful from the beginning to end and all of its fruits and what comes out of it. He then said to Eve, ‘I wish you to allow me to suck from this date as you allowed me to suck the grape. She gave him one date and he sucked it.

When he stops performing Salat (prayer) the angels scold him and Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says to him, ‘My servant, you have disbelieved and the angels have scolded you because of your evilness, My servant.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘It is evil, an evil that is real. By Allah, it is a great scolding, His name is glorious, His scolding of one hour is more severe than suffering for one thousand years.’ He (the narrator) has said that abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘. . . they are condemned wherever they live, they are taken and killed entirely.’ (33:61) He (the Imam) then said, ‘O Yunus, condemned is one who overlooks the command of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious. If he goes on land, he is destroyed and if he goes in the sea, he is drowned. He is subjected to anger because of the anger of the glorious One whose name is majestic.’” "

Say, ‘There is great sin in them and benefits for people but the sin in them is greater than their benefits.’” (2:219) When this verse was revealed people sensed the prohibition on it and prohibition on gambling. They learned that one must stay away from sins and that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, does not impose on them both ways because of His saying, “and benefits for people”. Thereafter Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent another verse, “Wine, gambling, signs (indicators of sins), and gambling arrows are filthy matters of the acts of Satan, therefore, you must stay away from them, perhaps you attain salvation.” (5:90) This verse is more intense than the previous one in being more forceful about the unlawfulness. Then is the third stage and the third verse which is even more forceful than the first and the second verses as Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, “Satan only wants to place animosity and hatred among you in wine and gambling and prevent you from speaking of Allah and from Salat (prayer). Why then do you not stay away from them?” (5:91) Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has commanded to stay away from them and has explained the reason because of which they are unlawful. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, then in the fourth verse has stated, besides these verses, saying, “Say (O Muhammad) my Lord has made unlawful only the sins which are clearly known and that which is not clearly known, the sin and rebellion without right.” In the first verse Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, “They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, ’There are great sins in them and there is benefit for people.’” In the fourth verse He has said to say, “My Lord has made unlawful only the sins which are clearly known and that which is not clearly known.” Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has informed that there is sin in wine and other things and that it is unlawful because when Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, decides to sanction an obligation He explains in gradual steps.

If others experience such a condition, they also do as he (the Messenger of Allah) did and in so doing they follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, otherwise, they do not follow the Sunnah.’ I then asked, ‘How did that happen?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When the Messenger of Allah was prevented from visiting the House, he had already driven his sacrificial animal to be offered as a sacrifice and had assumed the state of Ihram. Allah showed him in his dream, of which Allah has spoken in His book saying, “Allah certainly made the dream come true for the messenger in all truth. That is, you will enter al-Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Masjid) if Allah so wills, in peace with your heads shaved, and Taqsir (cut or trim a part of his nails or hair) being done without any fear.” (48:26) Thus, the Messenger of Allah learned that Allah would keep His promise about what He has shown him in the dream. For this reason he allowed his hairs that was on his head at the time of assuming the state of Ihram to grow, waiting for the time of shaving in al-Haram (the sacred area) as Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, had promised. When he shaved his head as part of the acts of his al-Hajj, he (the Messenger of Allah) thereafter did not allow his hairs to grow.
