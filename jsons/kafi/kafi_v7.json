Narrated to us Ali ibn Ibrahim from Ali ibn Ishaq from al-Hassan ibn Hazim al-Kalbiy son of the sister of Hisham ibn Salim from Sulayman ibn Ja‘far who has narrated the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that the Messenger of Allah has said, ‘A person who does not make a proper will at the time of his death suffers from lack of kindness and proper understanding.’ It was then asked, ‘O messenger of Allah, what kind of will should a dying person make?’ The Messenger of Allah replied, ‘When one is about to die and people gather around him he should say: “O Allah, the Inventor of the heavens and earth, who has the knowledge of the unseen and the present matters, the Beneficent, the Merciful. O Allah, I entrust You, in this world, with my testimony, ‘I testify that no one beside You (O Allah), who is One and has no partners, deserve to be worshipped. I also testify that Muhammad is your servant and Messenger. I testify that Paradise is true, Hellfire is true, Resurrection is true, that Accountability of everyone, on the Day of Judgment, is true, and Measurement and Balance are true. I testify that Religion is as You have described, that Islam is as You have established and the Word is as You have spoken, that the Quran is as You have sent down and that You are Allah, the manifest truth. I pray to Allah to compensate Muhammad, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, with the best of compensations and welcome Muhammad and his family with the (promised) peace. O Allah, You are my means and resource at the time of my living in distress, and You are my companion at the time of my suffering hardships. You are the Benefactor of bounties I have enjoyed. You are my Lord and the Lord of my ancestors. Do not ever leave me to myself; not even for a blinking of an eye, for if You leave me to myself for a blinking of an eye, I become closer to wickedness and move away from goodness. Comfort me in the grave against my fear and make this an open covenant in my favor on the day when I will come into Your presence.’” Thereafter he should make his will about the matters that he may need. Such a will is based on the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, in the Chapter of the Holy Quran where Mary is mentioned. “No one will possess any intercession (Shafa‘ah) except those who have entrusted the Beneficent to bear witness to their testimony.’” “It is a right upon every Muslim to memorize this will and testimony and teach it. Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘The Messenger of Allah taught me this will.’ The Messenger of Allah has said, ‘ Jibril taught me this will.’” "

If two people from the followers of the bible are not found then two Zoroastrians can bear witness. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, established a Sunnah about Zoroastrians like that for the people of the book in paying al-Jizyah (taxes). Thus, if one dies in loneliness in a strange land and cannot find two Muslims, he can appoint two men from the people of the book who are then kept in custody after Salat (prayer). They will take an oath on Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, saying that they do not sell their oath in exchange for a small price, even in favor of their relatives, that they do not hide the testimony for the sake of Allah; in so doing they will be committing sins.’ He (the Imam) said, ’This applies only when the heirs of the deceased doubt their testimony and it is found out that they have testified falsely. The heir cannot invalidate their testimony without presenting two witnesses who stand in place of the first two witnesses and take the oath on Allah that their testimony is more accurate than the testimony of the first two witnesses; if we transgress, we will be unjust. If this happens then the testimony of the first two becomes invalid and the testimony of the two later witnesses is admitted as valid. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, “This will help preserve a proper testimony. The witnesses will be afraid of the rejection of their own testimony by a second pair of witnesses. Have fear of Allah and listen (properly). Allah does not guide the evil doing people.” (5:108)”’ "

Tamim al-Dariy was a Muslim but ibn Baydiy and ibn Mariya were Christians and they were with Tamim al-Dariy who had certain assets and utensils, which were decorated with gold, and a necklace that he took for the Arab markets for sale. Tamim al-Dariy became ill severely and the time of his death came. He gave whatever he had to ibn Baydiy and ibn Mariya and asked them to deliver it to his heirs. The two came to al-Madinah, delivered the other things but they had taken the utensils and the necklace. The heirs found the utensils missing; so the family of Tamim asked the two men, ’Did he (Tamim) remain ill for a long time and incurred a large amount of expenses?’ The two replied, ‘He remained ill only for few days.’ They then asked, ’Was anything stolen from him during his journey?’ The two replied, ‘No, nothing was stolen from him during his journey.’ They then asked, ‘Did he make any business deals that caused him losses?’ The two replied, ‘No, he did not make any such deals.’ They then said, ‘The most expensive things are missing like the utensils decorated with gold and gems and a necklace.’ The two said, ‘Whatever he gave to us we have given to you.’ They then took the two before the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and he (the Messenger of Allah) judged that the two must take an oath. The two took an oath and they were released but the utensils and necklace were seen with them. The heirs of Tamim went to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah, our assets have been seen in the possession of ibn Baydiy and ibn Mariya.’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, waited to hear from Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, a judgment in the case. Allah, most Blessed, most High, then revealed, ‘Believers, when death approaches any one of you, allow two just men from your own people (Muslims) or any two other men (people of the book), if incident of death befalls you on a journey, bear witness to the bequest. [Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, applied the testimony of the people of the book about the will when it is on a journey and Muslims are not found] If you have any doubts about their (others’) honesty, detain them and allow them take an oath after the prayer, each one of them saying, “I swear by Allah that my testimony is true. I am not selling the Truth for a paltry price even though the beneficiary would be one of my relatives. I do not hide the testimony which is the right of Allah, for then I will be one of the sinners.” (5:106)’ This is the testimony, which is sanctioned by the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. Tf their honesty is challenged, [they took false oath], two others from the relatives of the deceased should swear in the same way and testify to the bequest saying, “We swear by Allah that our testimony is the more accurate one. We do not transgress in the matter lest we become unjust ones.” (5:107)’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, commanded the heirs of Tamim al-Dariy to take an oath according to His command. They took an oath and the Messenger of Allah took the utensils and the necklace from ibn Baydiy and ibn Mariya and returned them to the heirs of Tamim al-Dariy. This is the least in presenting the testimony as it is for fear of another oath’s rejection of their oath thereafter.” "

He possessed a number of slaves whom he set free at the time of his death. Had the slaves been sold, such a sale could pay all of his debts. ‘Isa ibn Musa asked them (ibn abu Layla’ and ibn Shubramah) about this case.

These are people of al-Hijaz today. A man indebted greatly is not allowed to free his slaves at the time of his death.” Ibn Shubramah then raised his hands to the sky and said, “Allah is free of all defects, O ibn abu Layla’ when did you ever say so?

Give us an example.’ I then said, ‘I debate you according to analogy.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You must present the strongest example of analogy.’ I then said, ‘There is a man who dies and leaves a slave and no other assets.

The assets that belong to me in Yanba’ which are known to be my assets with its surroundings are endowed as charities as well as the slaves except Rabah, abu Nayzar and Jubayr who are set free and no one has any authority over them. They are my Mawali who will work for five years with the properties from which will be their sustenance, expenses and the expenses of their families. Besides these my properties in Wadi al-Qura’, all of it is of the assets of the children of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, and the slaves are charities. My assets in Daymah and its people are charities except Zurayq. For him is what I write for his companions. My assets in ’Udhaynah and its people are charities and al-Fuqayrayn as you know are charities in the way of Allah. My assets that I have mentioned are charities in an obligatory sense, whether I will be living or dead. They will be used in the ways that will please Allah, for the cause of Allah, and for the sake of Allah, and for my relatives from banu Hashim, banu al- Muttalib, the nearer ones and the farther ones. Al-Hassan will supervise these properties. He will use them for his lawful needs and will spend in the sight of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, in lawful ways. It is not unlawful for him to do so. If he deems necessary to sell from these assets to pay off debts, he can do so if he will so like. It is not unlawful for him. If he will like he can make them very attractive assets. The children of Ali, their Mawali and assets are under the authority of al-Hassan ibn Ali. If the house of al-Hassan ibn Ali will not be the house of charity and if he will so decide to sell it he can do so. It is not unlawful for him. If he will sell it, he will divide its price in three parts: one- third in the way of Allah, one-third for banu Hashim and banu al-Muttalib, and keep one-third in the assets of Ale abu Talib. He will manage it in the sight of Allah as he deems it lawful. If something will happen to al-Hassan and al-Husayn will be living, then al-Husayn ibn Ali will be the person in charge of his task. Al-Husayn will deal with these assets just as al-Hassan had been dealing. He will have for himself what I have written for al-Hassan. On him will also be what was on al-Hassan. For the children of (the two sons of) Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, of the charities are whatever is for the children of Ali. I have prepared what I have prepared for the two sons of Fatimah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. It is for the sake of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, in the honor of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and for their greatness, in service of their nobility and pleasure. If something will happen to al-Hassan and al-Husayn, the last one of them will look among the children of Ali. If he will find among them one about whose guidance he is happy as well as his Islam and trustworthiness, he will designate him for the task if he will so wish. If he will not find among them anyone who can make him happy, he will designate someone from Ale abu Talib with whom he will be happy. If he will find all of Ale abu Talib, their elders and people of understanding have passed away, he then will designate a man from banu Hashim. He will place a condition on one to whom he will leave the assets that they must be left on their original basis, only their fruits will be spent as I have commanded, such as, in the way of Allah and for His sake, for the relatives of banu Hashim and banu al-Muttalib, those nearer and those farther. They must not be sold, gifted or inherited. The assets of Muhammad ibn Ali are on his side. It is for the two sons of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, to decide about it. My slaves whom I have listed in a small document are free. ‘This is what Ali ibn abu Talib has decided about his assets this morning of the day that he has arrived in Maskin (a place near al-Kufah on the bank of Euphrates) for the sake of Allah, seeking His pleasure, and for the dwelling in the next life. Allah is the support in all conditions. It is not lawful for a Muslim, who believes in Allah and the day to come, to say something about what I have decided about my assets or oppose me in my affairs of the people near or far. ‘Thereafter the mothers of my children with whom I maintain connections, seventeen of whom are mothers of children who are with their children, those of them who are pregnant and those who do not have children. My decision about them, if something happens to me is as follows: Those of them who do not have children and are not pregnant they are free for the sake of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious. No one will have any authority over them. Those of them who have children or are pregnant must keep their children as their share. If her child will die and she is living she then is free and no one will have any authority on them. This is the decision that Ali has made about his assets this morning when he has arrived in Maskin. It is witnessed by abu Samar ibn Abrahah, Sa‘sa‘h ibn Suhan, Yazid ibn Qays and Hayyaj ibn abu Hayyaj and it is written by Ali ibn abu Talib with his own hand on tenth of Jamadi al-’Ula’, in the year thirty-seven.’” There was another will (with the first one): “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “This is the will of Ali ibn abu Talib, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. I (Ali ibn abu Talib) testify that no one deserves worship except Allah alone, who has no partners, and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. He sent him with guidance, true religion to make it dominant over all other religions even though the pagans dislike. O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. My Salat (prayer), good deeds, life and death are for Allah, Lord of the worlds who has no partners. I am commanded for this and I am the first Muslim. “I make this will for you O al-Hassan and all members of my family, my children and those to whom my writing reaches, to be pious before Allah, your Lord, and do not die unless you are a Muslim. Hold firmly to the rope of Allah, all of you, and do not become scattered because of differences. I heard the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, saying, ’Establishing reconciliation and peace between two disputing people is better than all Salat (prayer) and fasting. That denouncing (each other) is destructive to religion and the good relationship between two people. There is no power without Allah, most High, most Great. You must look after your relatives and maintain good relations with them; Allah will make your accounting very easy.’ “(I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the orphans. You must not remain ignorant of the condition of what they eat and you must not allow yourselves to see that they are lost and destroyed in your presence. I heard the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, saying, ‘If one supports an orphan until he is independent Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, makes the garden (paradises) obligatory for him just as He makes the fire obligatory for those who consume the assets of the orphans.’ “(I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about al-Quran, you must not give others the chance to excel you in acting according to it. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about your neighbors; the Holy Prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, has urged to take care of them and he (the Messenger of Allah) continued urging about them until we thought that he will command to inherit each other. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the house of your Lord. You must not leave it without your presence as long as you are here. If it is left alone, you will not be given a chance to visit the house. The least that one, who intends to visit the house, brings back is forgiveness of the past sins. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about Salat (prayer); it is the best of deeds. It is the pillar of your religion. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, of Zakat because it extinguishes the anger of your Lord. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the month of Ramdan. Fasting in this month is the shield against the fire. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the poor and the destitute. You must share your financial resources with them. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about Jihad by means of your wealth, your souls and your tongue. Two kinds of men complete the duty of Jihad, the Imam of guidance or one obedient to him who follows his guidance. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the descendents of your prophet. You must not allow their being subjected to injustice in your presence and before your eyes when you are able to defend them. (I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about the companions of your Prophet, the companions who did not invent heresy or give protection to heretics. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, has urged to be good to them, has condemned the heretics among them and others who protect heretics. “(I remind you of) Allah, (I remind you of) Allah, about women and slaves. The last word your Prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, spoke was, T urge you to take care of the two weak kinds of people: the women and slaves.’ Salat (prayer), Salat (prayer), Salat (prayer). Do not fear the blame of blaming people; Allah is sufficient for you against their harming you and their rebelliousness against you. Speak to people about what is good as Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has commanded you. If you disregard urging people to do what is good and prohibit evil; Allah will make people of evil deeds to dominate you then you pray but it will not be answered in your favor. My sons, you must continue to maintain good relations, generosity and acting virtuously. You must not cut off good relations and turn away from each other because of differences. Cooperate with each other with virtuous deeds and piety and do not work together toward sin and animosity. Be pious before Allah because Allah’s punishment is intense and severe. I pray to Allah to protect you against harms, all of you, people of the house as He protected among you your Prophet. I leave you in the trust of Allah and offer you the greeting of peace, the kindness of Allah and His blessings.” “He (the Imam) then continued saying Tahlil, (no one deserves worship except Allah), until he passed away. O Allah, grant compensation to him (the Imam) and blessings, in the third night of the last ten days in the end of the twenty-third night of the month of Ramadan, on Friday night in the year forty after the migration of the Holy Prophet, from Makkah to al-Madinah. He was injured in the nineteenth night of the month of Ramadan.’” "

Abu Ali al-Ash ‘ariy has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar from Safwan and Muhammad ibn ’Isma‘il has narrated from al-Fadl ibn Shadhan from Safwan and Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Safwan and Muhammad ibn Yahya from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from Safwan ibn Yahya from ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Hajjaj who has narrated the following: “Abu al-Hassan, Musa, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, sent to him the will of his father with his charity through abu Tsma‘il Musadif. “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “This is the will of JaTar ibn Muhammad who testifies that no one deserves worship except Allah alone, who has no partners. To Him belongs the kingdom, to Him belongs all praise; He is living and does not die. In His hand is the good and He has power over all things, that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, that the Hour is coming without any doubt and that Allah will raise all people from the graves. Upon this (belief) we live and upon this we die and before Him we all will be raised to live by the will of Allah. He has made this will to his sons that they must not die unless they are Muslims, they must remain pious before Allah, establish peaceful relations among themselves as much as they can; they will continue living in good conditions as long as they do so. It is an obligation for which they will be recompensed. “He has made this will that if something happens to him if it is not changed, although he has the right to change as long as Allah keeps him living, that for so and so is such and such and for so and so and so and so is such and such that so and so is free. That he has made his will to so and so.” “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “This is what Musa ibn Ja‘far has verified and certified to be in so and so land, with so and so limits (boundaries). All of its palm trees, its land, its waters, surroundings, its rights, watering paths, its threshing field, its hills, its courtyards, branches, dividing marks, drainage passages, the inhibited and uninhibited parts are all given as charity. Along with all of its rights for his own children of his own seed, male and female, which will be divided among them whatever Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, will produce as its income after deducting the expenses of its maintenance, buildings, accessories. Thereafter thirty clusters must be kept to be divided among the destitute of the people of the town, who live with the children of Musa, for every male twice as much as the share of a female. If a female of the children of Musa marries, she will not have any right in this charity unless she comes back without her husband. If she did so, she will have the same share that she had before her marriage as being one of the daughters of Musa. Whoever of the children of Musa dies and leaves children, they will have the share of their father, each male will receive twice as much as the share of a female as Musa ibn JaTar has set as a condition in his children from his seeds. If any of the children of Musa dies and does not leave any children behind, his share will be given to the people of charity. The children of my daughters will not have any share in this much of my charity unless their father is of my children. No one else will have any share in my charity with my children or the children of my children and their descendents as long as anyone of them exists. If they are no more, then my charity will be for the children of my father from my mother as long as they exist, with the condition that I have set for my children and my descendents. If the children of my father from my mother all die, then my charity is for the children of my father and their descendents as long as any of them exist, with the condition that I have set upon my children and my descendents. When the children of my father are no more, then my charity is for the first and then the first in priority until Allah makes it inherit whom He will make to inherit; He is the best heir. “Musa has given this charity when he is in good health, an irrevocable charity in a complete sense without doubt or return, perpetually for the sake of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, and the dwelling in the hereafter. It is not lawful for any believing one who believes in Allah and the last day to sell it or any part thereof, give it as gift, or grant, change anything thereof as I have set forth until Allah will inherit the earth and all that is on it. “He has made this charity under the supervision of Ali and Ibrahim. When one of them is no more, al- Qasim joins the other. If then one of them is no more Tsma‘il will join the other one. If one of them is no more al- ‘Abbas will join the other one, if one of them is no more, then the eldest of my children will join the other, if no one of my children will exist except one then he will deal with the task.” Abu al-Hassan has thought that his father made Tsma‘il before al- ‘Abbas in the matters of charity who was younger than him.

Had you given priority to what Allah has given priority, kept back what Allah has kept back, placed people who possess divine authority and who inherit divine authority as Allah has placed, people who possess divine authority would not become needy. Obligations ordained by Allah would not remain neglected, two people would not quarrel [about a command of Allah and a nation would not fight over a command of Allah] but that the knowledge thereof is with us in the book of Allah.

Ahmad ibn Muhammad has narrated from Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Taymiy from Muhammad ibn al-Walid from Yunus ibn Ya’qub who has narrated the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that ’Amir al-Mu’minin has said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah. What Allah places last no one is able to place it first, and no one is able to place last what He has placed first.’ He (the Imam) then tapped his one hand with the other hand. He said, ‘O confused nation after her Prophet, had you placed first what Allah had done so and had you placed last what Allah had placed last, had you placed people who possess divine authority and who inherit divine authority as Allah had done, people who possess divine authority would not become needy. Deficiency did not occur in the ordained obligations toward Allah. No two people ever disagree on an issue of the laws of Allah or a nation fight over a thing of the commandments of Allah.

Muhammad ibn ’Isma‘il has narrated from al-Fadl ibn Shadhan from Muhammad ibn Yahya from Ali ibn ‘Abd Allah from Ya‘qub ibn Ibrahim ibn Sa‘d who has said that narrated to me my father from Muhammad ibn Ishaq who has said that narrated to me al- Zuhriy from ‘Ubayd Allah ibn ‘Utbah who has narrated the following: “I sat with ibn al- ‘Abbas that a mention of ordained shares of inheritance was made and ibn al- ‘Abbas said, ‘Allah is free of all defects, the most great. Do you think that one who enumerates the number of the grains of sand in a sand valley has designated half and half and one-third? The two halves take away the legacy then where is the room for the one-third?’ Zufar ibn ’Aws al-Basriy said, ‘O ibn al- ‘Abbas, who was the first one who caused excess or deficiency in the ordained shares? He said, ‘It was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab when several ordained shares were before him which he gave certain amount to certain people and he said, “I do not know which one of you is first and which one is last according to Allah and I do not find anything bigger to distribute this asset among you in shares.” So he deducted from each of those with ordained shares to offset for the deficiency. I swear by Allah had he placed first whom Allah had placed first and placed last whom Allah had placed last, then no deficiency would take place in the ordained shares.’ Zufar ibn ’Aws then said to him, ‘What has He placed first and what has He placed last?’ He said, ‘Every ordained share that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has not brought down from its being an ordained share except to another ordained share is what Allah has placed first. What Allah has placed last are such shares that when being moved from its status has no replacement except whatever is left, thus it is what Allah has placed last. The ordained shares that He has placed first are one-half, which is the share of a husband. When something is added to it then it is reduced to one-fourth and thereafter it is not removed to some other position. The share of a wife is one-fourth but when it is removed, it becomes one-eighth and then it remains without change. The share of a mother is one-third and when it is reduced, it becomes one-sixth and it then remains unchanged and these are the ordained shares that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has placed first. Of the shares, that Allah has placed last is the share of two daughters and sisters, which are one-half and two-thirds. However, when they are removed from these positions they are not placed in another position with the remaining of the legacy. Thus, they are that which Allah has placed last. When the ones that are placed first and those, who are placed last come together, the ones that are placed first are given priority. A complete right is given to the beneficiary; then if anything left is given to those whose shares Allah has placed last. If nothing remains then there is nothing for him.’ Zufar ibn ’Aws then said to him (ibn Abbas), ‘What stopped you from giving this advice to ‘Umar?’ He (ibn Abbass) said, ‘It is his fearsomeness. ’ Al-Zuhriy has said, ‘By Allah, had he (ibn Abbas) presented it before a just Imam, who based his command on justice and piety, who would approve it, (the idea of ibn Abbas) then it would pass (in practical form among people) because no two people have disputed over the knowledge of ibn al-‘ Abbas.’” "

Daughters of one’s son take the place of their father if the deceased does not leave behind a son and no one else inherits with them.’ “Al-Fadl has said, ‘Grandsons always keep the place of a deceased’s son; if a son from his seed does not exist [and] with them no one inherits except the parents of the deceased and husband and wife.’ If a deceased leaves behind a grandson and granddaughter from his son the legacy is given to them with the male receiving twice as much as the share of a female. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a grandson from the side of his son and a granddaughter from the side of his daughter the grandson from the side of the son receives two-thirds and the granddaughter from the side of the daughter receives one-third. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a granddaughter from his son and a granddaughter from his daughter, the granddaughter from his son receives two-thirds of the legacy and the granddaughter from his daughter receives one-third of the legacy. The rule in such case is like the rule for sons and daughters from one’s seed, for the children of one’s son is two-thirds and for the children of daughters is one-third. If a deceased leaves behind three sons or daughters of whom certain ones are of the next generation; the legacy in such case belongs to the generation before it. The next generation does not inherit anything because of the closest generation. The same is the case when all of them are daughters and in the next generation there is a boy, then the entire legacy belongs to the generation before, not for the next generation; the generation closer to the deceased is more deserving of the legacy. An example of this is when a deceased leaves behind a grandson from his daughter and a great grandson from the daughter of his son. The legacy in this case belongs to the grandson from his daughter because he is the closest to the deceased. So also is the case if a deceased leaves behind daughter of his daughter and son of the daughter of his son. In this case, the legacy belongs to the daughter of his daughter because she is closest to the deceased. The same is the case when a deceased leaves behind a daughter of his daughter and his great grandson, in which case the entire legacy belongs to the granddaughter; she is of closest generation. The same is the case also if a deceased leaves behind a grandson from his daughter and granddaughter from his daughter, a woman and other relatives. The woman’s share is one-eighth and the remaining is distributed between the granddaughter and grandson from his daughter; for each male twice as much as the share of a female. Thus, the legacy is made into twenty- four shares, one-eighth for the woman, which is three shares, for the granddaughter seven shares and for the grandson from the daughter fourteen shares. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a husband, a granddaughter from his daughter and a grandson from his daughter, the share of the husband is one-fourth and the rest of the legacy belongs to the granddaughter and grandson; each male’s share twice the share of the female which can be taken from four shares. The husband receives one share, the grandson from his daughter receives two shares and the granddaughter from his daughter receives one share. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a son of her daughter, the son of her son and her husband, the husband receives one-fourth and the rest belongs to the son of her daughter and the son of her son. The share of the son of her daughter is the share of his mother, which is one-third. The share of the son of her son is the share of her son, which is two-thirds, and this also can be distributed from four shares. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a husband and a daughter of her daughter the share of the husband is one- fourth and the rest of the legacy belongs to the daughter of her daughter. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a daughter of a daughter and both parents, then the share of parents are two-sixths. The share of a daughter of a daughter is one-half. The one remaining share is given to them as the remaining returned proportionate to their shares. Thus, the remaining is made into five parts of which the parents receive two shares and the daughter of the daughter receives three shares. If a deceased leaves behind a son of a daughter and both parents whose shares are two-sixths and the share of the son of the daughter is one-half which also can be distributed from five shares of which two shares are for the parents and three shares are for the son of the daughter. ‘If a deceased leaves behind a daughter of a son and both parents whose share is two-sixths and the remaining belongs to the daughter of the son, and this can be divided from six shares, of which two shares are for the parents and four shares for the daughter of the son.’ “Al-Fadl has said that one proof of the mistake that people make is in matters of inheritance of the children of daughters. They consider the children of daughters like the children of man from his seed in all rules except in inheritance. In this case they in consensus all say that wife of the son of the daughter is not lawful for a man or the wife of the son of son of a daughter. It is because of the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious . . women lawful for your sons who are from your seed.’ (4:23) If in this case the son of the daughter is the son of a man from his seed; why does it not apply in inheritance to the son of the daughter? So also they have said, ‘If a man divorces his wife before going to bed with her; that women is not lawful for the son of his daughter because of the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, ‘. . .do not marry whom your fathers (ancestors) have married of women.’ (4:22) How then has man here become the father of the son of his daughter and he does not become his father in matters of inheritance? So also, they have said, ‘It is unlawful to marry a woman who was married to the son of one’s daughter.’ In the same way, they have said that if one testifies for the father of one’s mother or for the son of a daughter, his testimony and similar testimony is not acceptable in many of their judgments. When they come to the issue of inheritance they say that the son of a daughter is not considered as one’s son and he is not considered his father, because of their following their ancestors who wanted to invalidate al-Hassan and al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, because of their mother but Allah is the supporter. This is what Allah has stated in His book in His words, ‘To everyone We gave guidance and We guided Nuh before and of the offspring of Dawud and Sulayman and Ayyub . . . and Jesus and ‘Ilyas qhow were all pious people.’ (6:84-85) He has called Jesus from the descendents of Adam and Nuh when he is the son of a daughter because Jesus had no father; then why is it that the children of a daughter of a man are not considered as one’s children? Yes, it is true if they want fairness and the truth, only Allah grants good opportunity.” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘I do not find anyone who has spoken about it but that they have spoken out of their opinion except ’ Amir al- Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam.

Tomorrow meet me, so I will make you read in a book.’ The next day I went to see him (the Imam) after al-Zuhr (noontime) and it was the hour that I would meet him between al-Zuhr and al-‘Asr (afternoon time) and I did not like to ask him in the presence of people for fear of his answering in taqiyah (caution because of fear). When I met him (the Imam) his son Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, came to me and he (the Imam) said to him, ‘Make Zurarah to read the book of ordained shares.’ He (the Imam) left for his siesta. Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and I were left in the house. He stood up and brought for me a book (which looked) like the thigh of a camel. He (Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam ) said, ‘I will not allow you to read it until you promise before Allah that you will never tell anyone about what you will read in it until I will give permission’, and he did not say, ‘until my father gives you permission.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep you well, why do you restrict me when your father has not commanded you to do so?’ He said, ‘You must not look in it on what is other than what I will tell you to read.’ I said, ‘That is up to you.’ I was a knowledgeable man in ordained shares of inheritance and wills and well aware of them and in calculating them. I waited for quite a long time to find something about ordained shares and wills that I did not know and can deal with. When he placed a side of the book before me, it was a thick book and one can notice that it was of the books of earlier generations. I looked in it and I found it to be different from what is commonly accepted among people, such as matters of compensation and urging others to do good things, in which there is not any difference. I found the majority of it like that until the end of it, with a filthy soul, very little memorization and defective opinion; and I said, ‘Do I (need) to read this?’ It is false. I reached its end. I closed it and returned it to him (Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam ). The next day I met abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and he asked me, ‘Did you read the book of ordained shares?’ I replied, ‘Yes, I read it.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘How did you find what you read?’ He (the narrator) has said that he said, ‘It is false and it does not have any valid effect. It is against what people say and do.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘What you saw O Zurarah, by Allah, is the truth. What you saw is the dictation of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, in the handwriting of Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam.’ Satan came to me with temptation in my chest and said, ‘He does not know if it is the dictation of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and the handwriting of Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He (the Imam) said to me before I spoke, ‘O Zurarah, do not doubt. Satan loved to make you doubt. How it is possible that I remain ignorant of its not being the dictation of the Messenger of Allah and the handwriting of Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, when my father narrated to me from my grandfather ’ Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, who narrated to him about it.’ He (the narrator) has said that I said, ‘No, I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause. I regretted for not reading what I did not read of the book. Had I read it and I had known it I would hope not to miss anything thereof; not even a single letter.’ “‘Umar ibn ’Udhaynah has said, ‘I said to Zurarah that people have spoken to me from him (the Imam) and from his father, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, about certain things on ordained shares. Can I present them before you so you can tell me what is false and what is true and do not narrate so I remain quiet? I narrated to him what Muhammad ibn Muslim had narrated from abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the daughter and father and about a daughter and both parents. He said that it is true. “Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan about a daughter and father has said, that the daughter receives one-half and the father receives one-sixth and the remaining is returned to them proportionate to their shares. “So also is the case if a deceased leaves behind a daughter and mother. One-half belongs to the daughter, the mother receives one-sixth, and the remaining is returned to them proportionate to their shares. Certain people have said that the remaining belongs to the daughter because she is closer than both parents are. It is a mistake totally; the parents are close by themselves as the children are, but children are not closer than parents are. The correct thing is to return the remaining to all of them proportionate to their shares. They have received their shares and as nearest relatives the remaining asset belongs to them as relatives, thus it is divided among them according to the distribution of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, among them. Allah does not cause difference in His rule and His division does not change.’ “If a deceased leaves behind one daughter and both parents then one-half belongs to the daughter and the parents receive one-sixth. The remaining is returned to them proportionate to their shares because Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has not returned to one and not to the other one. He has made a share for women just as He has made a share for men. It is equal in this obligation between mother and father. If a deceased leaves behind two daughters and both parents, the share of daughters is two- thirds and parents receive two-sixths. If a deceased leaves behind three daughters or more then the share of parents is two-sixths and the daughters receive two-thirds. If a deceased leaves behind parents and one son and one daughter, the parents receive two-sixths and the remaining is distributed among the son and daughter where the son receives twice as much as the share of the daughter.”’ "

Abu ‘Abd Allah, and abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, were asked about a case in which a deceased woman left behind her husband, her mother and two daughters. He (the Imam) said, ‘The husband receives one-fourth of the legacy, the mother receives one-sixth and the rest belongs to the two daughters. It is because if they were two men, they would not receive more than what remained after deducting the shares of the mother and husband, and the share of female is never more than the share of males.

The remaining are five shares which are returned to the daughter and one of the parents, proportionate to their shares and nothing is returned to the woman. If a deceased leaves behind both parents, a woman and daughter, this also can be distribution from twenty-four shares of which two- sixth, eight shares, is for the parents four for each, the woman receives one-eighth, three shares out of twenty-four and the daughter receives one-half, twelve shares. The remaining one share is returned to the daughter and both parents, proportionate to the ratio of their shares and nothing is returned to the woman. If a deceased leaves behind the father, husband and a daughter, the father receives two shares out of twelve, which is one-sixth.

No one of the creatures of Allah inherits with a child except parents, husband and wife. If there are no children but the children of children, male or female, they keep the place of their parents. Children of sons are like the sons and inherit like sons and children of daughters keep the place of daughter, they inherit like daughter and bar parents, husband and wife from their shares of a larger amount, even if they are lower generations like one, two, three or more generations.

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from ‘Umar ibn ’Udhaynah from Zurarah who has narrated the following: “Zurarah has said that al-‘Ammah (non-Shi‘ah) in their rules, decisions and ordained shares say something on consensus which is authoritative and binding upon them. In the case of a deceased who leaves behind his daughter or two daughters and his brother from his father and mother or his sister from his father and mother or his sister from father or his brother from his father, they give one-half to the daughter, two-thirds to the two daughters and the rest of legacy to his brother from his father and mother or his sister from his father or his sister from his father and mother, and not to the relatives from sons of his uncle or children of his brother. They do not give anything to the brothers from the mother. He (the narrator) has said that I said to them this is binding upon you. Allah has mentioned for brothers from the mother that Kalalah (burdensome people) inherit. Why do you not give them with a daughter anything when you give the sister from father, mother, and sister from father the rest of legacy instead of uncle and relatives? Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has mentioned them as Kalalah just as He has called brothers from mother as Kalalah. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, ‘They ask your fatwa. Say Allah gives you a fatwa about Kalalah.’ Why you have separated them from each other? They say that it is because of Sunnah and consensus of the group. We ask, ‘Is it the Sunnah of Allah and the Sunnah of His messenger or the Sunnah of Satan and his friends?’ They say, ‘It is the Sunnah of so and so.’ We say, ‘You have followed us in two issues and opposed us in two issues. We say, ‘If a deceased leaves behind one of the four then Kalalah of the deceased does not inherit. If he leaves a father or a son, you say, ‘You are right.’ We say, ‘If he leaves behind mother or a daughter.’ You deny it. You have followed us about the daughter. You do not give to brothers from mother anything and you have opposed us about mother. Why do you give one-third to brothers from the mother with the mother when she is living and they inherit because of her right and relation? Brothers and sisters from the father and mother and brothers and sisters from the mother do not inherit with the father (existing); they inherit because of the father, so also brothers and sisters from the mother do not inherit with the mother (esisting). More strange is that you say, ‘Brothers from the mother do not inherit one-third, they bar the mother from one-third and she only receives one-sixth.’ It is due to ignorance and it is untrue. Consensus is falsely made about it. I then said to Zurarah, ‘Do you say it from your own opinion?’ He said, ‘If I say this from my opinion I will be a sinful person. I testify that it is the truth from Allah and the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause.’” "

Allah has said, ‘. . . her share is one-half.’ He has also said for the brother who inherits her, that is, all of her legacy if she does not have any children. So you do not give anything to the one for whom Allah has given all the legacy in certain laws of your ordained shares but you give complete to one whom Allah has given one-half.’ The man said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep you well, how do we give one-half to the sister and we do not give the male heir if she was a male?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘About a mother, husband, a brother from the mother and a sister from her father they give one-half to the husband. They give one-sixth to the mother, to the brothers from her mother one-third and to the sister from her father One-half of three. You can make nine and it is from six but is raised to nine.

There was testimony that this party had bred it in their barn, which they did not sell, or gift; and the other party presented testimony that they had bred it in their barn and had not sold or gifted.

He (the Imam) said, Tf the father of the one who lives there had taken it without price and the one living in it did not present testimony but that he has inherited it from his father’, he (the Imam) said, Tf this is the case it then belongs to the one who has claimed it and has presented testimony.’” (In al-Masalik it is said that when testimonies contradict and the asset is in their hand they each receive one-half) "

The boy is an oppressive and aggressive boy who wants to disgrace her in her tribe, that she is a girl from Quraysh who has not married anyone and that she still has the seal of the Lord, on her. ‘Umar then asked the boy, ‘What do you say?’ He replied, ‘O ’Amir al-Mu’minin, by Allah she is my mother who bore me for nine months in her womb, breastfed me for two years. When I began to move, learned what is good and what is bad and which is my right and my left she expelled me, disowned me and thought that she did not know me.’ ‘Umar then asked her, ‘What does the boy say?’ She replied, ‘O ’Amir al-Mu’minin, I swear by the One who is hidden in light, no eye can see Him and by the right of Muhammad and his progeny, that I do not know him and I do not know to which people does he belong except that he is a boy whose claim disgraces me in my tribe.

Her story was that she was an orphan with a man who very often remained absent from his family. The orphan girl matured and the woman feared her husband’s being attracted to the young girl. She called certain of her neighbor women to hold the girl and she with her finger destroyed the virginity of the young girl in the absence of her husband and accused her of committing fornication, presented testimony of her neighbor women, who had helped her, before ’Umar who did not know how to deal with the case. ’Umar then asked the people, ’Allow us to go before Ali ibn abu Talib, ‘Alayhi al-Salam.’ They came to Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and told him (the Imam) the story. He (the Imam) asked the wife of the man if she had testimony and evidence. She said, ’I have witnesses. These are my neighbors who testify against her about what I have said’ and she brought them in. Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, took the sword out of its sheath and placed it before him. He (the Imam) commanded to keep each one of them in a separate home. He (the Imam) called the woman of the man and questioned her in several ways but she remained firm on her accusation in her position. He (the Imam) then returned her to her room, called another one of the witnesses when he was sitting with his legs folded backward, and said, ‘Do you know that I am Ali ibn abu Talib and this is my sword. The woman of the man has said what she said and turned to the truth. I granted her amnesty but if you will not tell me the truth I will fill you up with the sword.’ She then turned to ’Umar and said, ‘O ’ Amir al-Mu’minin, will you grant me amnesty?’ Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘Tell the truth.’ She said, ‘No, by Allah, when she saw the beauty of the young girl, she feared that her husband may become attracted to her and that may destroy her relation with him. She then made her drink an intoxicating drink, called us to hold her down and she then destroyed her virginity with her finger.’ Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said Takbir (Allah is great beyond description). He (the Imam) then said, ‘I am the first one to separate the witnesses from each other besides Daniel, the Prophet.’ He then subjected the women to the penalty applicable to falsely accusers and made all of them to pay mahr (dower) of the girl, which was four hundred dirham. He (the Imam) commanded the woman to be divorced by her husband and gave the girl in marriage to him. Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, paid the mahr (dower) for him. ‘Umar then asked, ‘O abu al-Hassan, tell us about the story of Daniel. Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said that Daniel was an orphan, a boy without parents. Among the Israelites, there was an old woman who cared for him. One of the kings of the Israelites had two judges who had a virtuous friend. Their friend had a beautiful woman. He would meet the king and speak to him. The king needed a man to send for a task so he asked the judges to find for him someone for the task. They said that so and so is proper for this task. The man then said to the two judges, ‘I ask you to look after the welfare of my wife in my absence.’ They said, ‘Yes, we will do so.’ The man left and the two judges would go to the door of their friend at certain times and they fell in love with his woman. They tried to seduce her but she refused. They said to her, ‘By Allah, if you do not agree with us we will testify before the king against you for fornication, then you will be stoned to death.’ She said, ‘You can do what you want.’ They went to the king, informed him of their story, and testified before him against her for her committing fornication. The king was troubled a great deal with sadness. He also liked her. He then said to them, ‘Your words are acceptable but stone her to death after three days.’ He called people of the town where he lived to attend the stoning to death of so and so worshipper woman because of her committing fornication and that the two judges have testified against her, so great many people gathered. The king asked his vizier for help who said, ‘I have no way out of this.’ The vizier on the third day went out and it was the last day for her when he saw children playing naked and among them was Daniel whom he did not know. Daniel said to the children, ‘O children allow me to be the king. You, so and so pretend to be the worshipper woman and so and so with so and so be the two witnessing judges against her.’ He collected soil, made a sword out of a piece of reed, and told the children, ‘Take the hand of this and move him away to so and so place.’ He then called the other and said to him, ‘Speak the truth because if you did not speak the truth I will put you to death.’ The vizier standing listened and watched it all. He said, ‘I testify that she committed fornication.’ He asked, ‘When was it?’ He replied, ‘It was on so and so day.’ He then said, ‘Take him away to his place and bring the other one.’ They took him away and brought the other one.

He (the Imam) then asked, ‘Is it not the case that one of you took out five and the other took out three loafs of bread from his supplies?’ They replied, ‘Yes, that is true.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘Did your guest not eat equal to what each one of you did?’ They replied, ‘Yes, that is true.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘Is it not the case that each one of you ate three loafs less one-third of a loaf?’ They replied, ‘Yes, that is true.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Did you, owner of three, not eat three loafs less one-third of a loaf? Did you, the owner of five loafs, not eat three loafs less one-third of a loaf of bread and your guest ate three loafs less one-third of a loaf?

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Ali ibn Hadid from certain persons of our people who have narrated the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Swearing is of three kinds. There is one kind of swearing, which does not require expiation, the kind that requires expiation, and the false swearing which causes the fire. The kind, which does not require expiation, is the swearing in which one has sworn by Allah for a good cause not to do it and its expiation is doing such thing. The kind of oath, which requires expiation, is that which a man takes for not to do a sinful deed but he does it, then expiation becomes obligatory. Al-Ghumus oath is that which causes the fire and is that in which a man swears against the right of a Muslim man to withhold his assets.”’ Ali ibn Ibrahim has said the following: “He (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that swearing is of three kinds. There is the kind of swearing because of which fire becomes obligatory, the oath, which makes expiation obligatory, and the kind, which does not make the fire or expiation obligatory. The kind of swearing which makes the fire obligatory is the swearing of a man who swears and denies the assets of another. In this way, he takes it away from him or swears against a Muslim man falsely to tangle him or seek the support of Sultan and so on against him in which he succeeds and causes the loss of his life or his assets. For this kind, fire becomes obligatory. The oath because of which expiation becomes obligatory is that which a man takes about a lawful act in the sight of Allah to do it or swears to do something, which is not lawful not to do it, then he repents, in such case expiation becomes obligatory. The kind of oath, which does not require expiation, is that which one takes to cut off good relations with relatives or the Sultan forces him or against his wishes his father or his wife urges him. He swears for an act which is in disobedience to Allah, he swears to do so although he commits a sin, but there is not any expiation on him.’” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘It is eighty.’ Ja‘far asked, ‘O my master, he will ask me for a reason.’ Abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says, ‘We have helped you in Mawatin al-Kathirah (in a great many places)’ and we counted them, they were eighty such places.’” "
