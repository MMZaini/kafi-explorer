        "englishText": "4. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from al-Hassan ibn Mahbub from certain individuals of his people who has said the following: “Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, once wrote in a letter to a certain individual of the Amawide rulers the following: “Of his neglectfulness one example is his disregard of the duty of Jihad (serving in the army) which Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has given preference over all other good deeds. He (Allah) has given preference to those serving in the army over the doers of good deeds a very clear preference in matters of high positions, their receiving forgiveness and mercifulness. This is because by serving in the army religion is supported to become public and it is defended thereby as well. By means of Jihad (a person’s serving in the army) Allah has purchased believers’ souls and property as their payment for paradise which is a gainful bargain indeed. He (Allah) has set upon them the condition of their abiding by the rules of armed engagement. Of such rules is calling to the obedience of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, instead of obedience to people (servants of Allah), to the worship of Allah instead of worshipping other servants of Allah and to accept guardianship of Allah instead of seeking guardianship of the servants of Allah. Those who are asked to pay taxes but refuse are executed and their families are taken into custody. “There is no calling of servants of Allah to the obedience of other servants of Allah. Those who agree to pay taxes are not violated, their covenant is safe guarded, and is not burdened beyond what he can afford. “The properties captured from the enemies belong to all Muslims and not to a particular group. If an armed confrontation takes place and people are captured, the whole issue is dealt with according to his (the Holy Prophet’s) dealings and traditions which are of religion’s rules in such issues. He (the particular ruler) then placed the burden of serving in the army upon such people as those with disabilities like blind or lame and those who do not have the means to serve in the army, after being excused by Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and those who cannot afford. The residents of a city are required to fight only the nearby enemy with fairness and justice exercised in issues of mobilization. All such laws were disregarded and people are made to live in one of the two conditions: To live like the person who offers a certain service but instead of receiving wages is made to pay, although Allah has already purchased his services; and a person who asks to rent or hire an item but the party of other side of his contract is bankrupt and indebted, although Allah has excused him. He has ignored al-Hajj in disregard and people are left in poverty. Who then is more crooked than this that has made such straightforward laws seem crooked and who is more straightforward than him who properly follows them? Instead he has made people to serve in the army (unduly) and has made such a service an extra burden and this is a great mistake and sin.’” "

Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Sa‘id has narrated from Ja’far ibn ‘Abd Allah al-‘Alawiy and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Kufiy from Ali ibn al-‘Abbas, from Isma’il ibn Ishaq, all from abu Faraj ibn Qurrah, who has narrated from Mas’adah ibn Sadaqah. He has said that narrated to him ibn abu Layla’ from abu ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sullamiy who has said that Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said who has said the following: “Thereafter, (my praising Allah) you must take notice that Jihad (serving in the army) is one of the doors to paradise. Allah has opened it for His special friends whom He has made to deserve it through His generosity toward them and a bounty, which He has stored. Jihad is the garment of piety and it is Allah’s invincible gown and strong shield. If one ignores it in disregard Allah dresses him up in humiliation. Misfortune engulfs him, small and worthless issues humiliate him and barriers block his heart. Truth moves away from him due to his disregard of Jihad. Hardship disturbs him and he is denied justice. I certainly have been asking you days and nights, privately and in public to fight those people (supporters of Mu‘awiyah), saying, ‘Attack them before they do so. By Allah, a people attacked in their own territory are always humiliated.’ You kept postponing my calls in betrayal until attacks were launched upon you and territories were captured. It is the brother of Ghamid (Sufyan ibn ‘Awf, Mu‘awiyah’s hit-man) whose troops have entered al-Anbar and have murdered Hassan ibn Hassan al-Bakriy (the governor appointed by Amir al-Mu’minin). Your troops were dislodged from their fortifications. I am informed that their men violate Muslimah women as well as tax-payers’ women, took away their bracelets, earrings and their other ornaments and they had no means of defense against them except begging for mercy and saying ‘to Allah we return.’ They then left with plenty of wealth and none of them suffered any injuries or lost a single drop of blood. If a Muslim would die in sorrow and anguish due to this tragedy he should not be blamed and in my opinion it is worthwhile of him. It indeed is shocking, by Allah, it is shocking. It causes the heart to melt and fills it up with sorrow to see how those people are united around their falsehood and your suffering discord despite your having the truth with you. It is a shame and a disgrace that despite your being their target of attack, you do not counter-attack them. They fight you but you do not fight. Allah is disobeyed and you condone such disobedience. When I command you to march against the enemy during summer you say, ‘It is very hot. Give us time until the heat is reduced.’ When I command you to march against them during winter, you say, Tt is very cold. Give us time until the cold season is over.’ All of such excuses are just to run away from hot and cold elements. If you run away from hot and cold seasons, from swords, by Allah, you will run away much faster. O you, who look like a man, you are not a man of courage. You in wish-fullness are like children and your power of reason is like that of the house- maidens. I wish I had not seen you and had not know you at all. It by Allah has brought only regret and sorrow. I wish Allah fights against you for filling up my heart with sadness as if it is filled with puss and my chest with anguish as if you have made me breathe blows of sorrow with every breath. You have turned my decision to no effect due to your disobedience and betrayal, so much so that Quraysh says, The son of abu Talib is a brave man but he does not know how to fight a war.’ One should for the sake of Allah, judge what they say. Has anyone among them dealt with wars with greater intensity than the way I have dealt with them or has anyone among them been involved with wars for such a long time as I have been facing wars? I stood firm in wars when I was not yet in my twenties and now I am in my sixties but one who is not obeyed has no opinion.” "

He faces the enemy with the support of the nation to fight. ‘The optional Jihad is every optional institution for the establishment of which one strives hard to accomplish and revive.

Through the same chain of narrator he has narrated from al-Minqariy from Hafs ibn Ghiyath who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that once a man asked my father, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the wars in which Amir al-Mu’minin, had taken part. The man asking the question was of our followers. Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, replied, ‘Allah sent Muhammad, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, with five swords. Three of them are taken out of their sheath and they are not sheathed until war is no more. The day without war will not come until the sun rises from the west. When the sun rises from its westerly direction all people will enjoy peace on that day. On that day a soul’s belief will be of no benefit if it did not exist before or has not gained any good thereby. One of those swords is withheld and the other one remains in its sheath and he has uncovered it on people other than us but it is up to us to decide. ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious has said, “Destroy the pagans wherever you find them; capture, detain them and set up surveillance over their activities. If they repent (accept the faith), perform Salat (prayer) and pay Zakat, they are your brothers in religion.” (9:11) The choice for such people is only acceptance of al-Islam or destruction. Their properties and offspring are held and detained and are dealt with in the way the Messenger of Allah had done. He detained, forgave or released them in exchange for ransom. ‘The second sword is in matters of dealing with the taxpayers. Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, has said, “Speak to people good words.” (2:83). This verse was revealed about the tax payers. Later it was amended by the following verse, “Fight those, who do not believe in Allah and in the Day of Judgment and do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful. Thus, they do not follow the true religion. However, they are of the followers of the book. (This is the case) until they agree to pay taxes by their own hands with humbleness.” (9:30) Those of them who live in the Muslims lands must pay taxes or be destroyed, their offspring detained and no Fay ’ (ransom) is accepted from them. But if they agree to pay taxes it becomes unlawful for us to detain them or touch their properties. It becomes lawful to marry from them. Those of such people who live in the war zones can be detained and their properties withheld. It is not lawful to marry from them and they are given the choices of either moving to the lands of the Muslims, pay taxes or be destroyed. ‘The third sword is to deal thereby with non- Arab pagans, such as al-Turk, al-Daylam and al-Khazar. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in the beginning of the Chapter that speaks of “those who disbelieve” has stated their story and said, “It, then, is to strike their necks until they are subdued and captured, thereafter either freed as a favor or in exchange for ransom until the war is no more.” (47:4) His words, “freed as a favor” means after they are detained and His words, “or in exchange for ransom” means in exchange for protection of the interests of the Muslim people. In the case of such people the choice is either destruction or acceptance of al-Islam. It is not lawful for us to marry from them as long as they live in the war zone. ‘The withheld sword is to deal thereby with the rebels and people who raise the issue of interpretations of the texts of the law. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “If two groups of believers fight each other, you must establish reconciliation between them. If one group rebels against the other then you must fight the rebellious one until it submits to the command of Allah.” (49:9) When this was revealed the Messenger of Allah said, “Among you there will be those who fight to establish proper interpretation of (the text of law) just as their fighting to establish the revelation of the text of the law.” The Holy Prophet then was asked, “Who will be such fighters?” He (the Messenger of Allah) replied, “One who is stitching his shoes”, meaning thereby Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. ‘Ammar ibn Yasar has said, “I have fought under this banner alongside the Messenger of Allah three times and this is the fourth time. I swear by Allah, if they beat us to make us retreat even all the way to the twigs of Bahrain, we will still remain certain of our truthfulness and their following falsehood. Dealings by ’Amir al-Mu’minin ‘Alayhi al-Salam, with them were just like those of the Holy Prophet toward the people of Makkah on the day of its conquest. Their offspring were not detained, and he said, ‘Those who keep their doors closed are protected.’ Those who put down their arms are protected. So also did Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, on the day of Basra. He announced among them, ‘You must not detain any of their offspring, you must not attack the wounded, you must not pursue the fleeing and those who close their doors and put down their arms are all protected.’” ‘The sword in the sheath is the sword whereby retaliation for a slain person takes place. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “A soul for a soul and an eye for an eye . . .” (5:45) He has made it ready for the heirs of the slain person but the application of its rule is left up to us to decide. These are the swords that Allah sent to Muhammad, O Allah grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause). Whoever rejects them or anyone of them or anything of their characteristics or rules has rejected what Allah has revealed to Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause.’” "

Is it only for a certain group besides whom for others it is not permissible or it is permissible for all who believe in Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious and in the Messenger of Allah? Whoever is as such has permission to call to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, to His obedience and do Jihad for His cause? “He (the Imam) replied, ‘It is for a certain people only. It is not lawful for others beside them. No one other than one who is of these certain people has the right to do Jihad? I then asked, ‘Who are these people?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘They are those who stand by the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious during the war and Jihad is done by the army. Such people have permission to call to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. Those who do not stand up to the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in war about the soldiers, do not have permission for Jihad and calling to Allah until they make Allah’s stipulations about Jihad rule and govern them? I then said, ‘Explain it to me. I pray to Allah to grant you favors? “He (the Imam) said, ‘Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, informed His prophet in His book how to call people to Him and has described it therein. He has made Jihad of degrees, which can be understood by means of one another and one leads to the other. He, the most Blessed, the most High, has informed that He Himself calls to His own-self and to His obedience and to following His commands. He has begun with Himself saying, “Allah calls to the house of peace and guides whomever He wants to the right path.” (10:25) He then has enjoined upon His Messenger and has said, “O Muhammad, call to the path of your Lord with wisdom, good advice and reason with them with that which is good.” (16:125) It means that he should reason with them by means of the Holy Quran. One who opposes the commands of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, is not calling to Allah. He only calls to Allah by that which is other than with which He has commanded in His book to call thereby and it is that in which He has commanded not to call by any means other than this (book). About His Holy Prophet He has said, “You certainly guide to the right path.” (42:52) It “guide” means you call to the right path. He, the most Blessed, the most High, has joined a third party for this task which is His book saying, “This Quran guides (calls) to that which is upright and gives glad news to the believers.” (17:9) “He then has mentioned those who after His own self, His prophet and His book have permission to call to Him saying, ‘Among you there must exist people who call to goodness, command (people) to do what is good and prohibit (people) from committing evil deeds; such are the successful ones? (3:104) He has given more information about who this ’Ummah (nation) is that it is of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isma’il, of the residents of the sacred land, of the ones who never worshipped anyone besides Allah. They are those on whom it is obligatory to call. It is the call of Ibrahim and Isma’il of the people of al-Masjid about whom Allah has spoken in His book that He has removed from them all rijs and has cleansed them thoroughly. They are those whom we have mentioned when speaking of the followers of Ibrahim, ‘Alayhi al-Salam who are meant to be the ones about whom Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, speaks in the following verse, “I call to Allah with awareness on my part as well as those who follow me.” (12:108) It is a reference to those who followed him in belief in him and affirmation of his truthfulness about whatever he had brought from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. They are of the ‘Ummah in whom he was sent and to whom he belonged and to whom he was sent before the creation of those who never considered anyone as partner of Allah and who never mixed their belief with injustice which is paganism. He then has mentioned the followers of His prophet and the followers of this ’Ummah which He has described in His book as the ones who command people to do good and prohibit them from committing evil and has considered them as the callers to Him and has given them permission to call to Him saying, “O prophet, Allah is sufficient (support for you) and those who follow you of the believers.” (8:64) He then has described the followers of His prophet of the believers and He, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and those who are with him are stern against the unbelievers. They are compassionate to each other. You can see them performing Ruku’s and Sajdah, to seek extra favors from Allah, and pleasure. Their marks are found on their faces because of frequent Sajdah. This is how they are described in the Torah and their description in the bible is. . . .” (48:29) ‘He has also said, “On the day when Allah will not fail the prophet and the believers. They will have their light run in front of them and on their right sides.” (66:8) It is a reference to the believers. Allah has said, “Believers are indeed successful.” (23:2) He then has praised and described them in a very special way so that no one other than those who are like them can consider themselves as one of them. In their praise and in their description He has said, “They are those who are khashV (very humble) in their Salat (prayer), those who stay away from useless matters. . . . they are the ones who inherit, those who inherit paradise wherein they live forever.” (23:3-11) He has also said in their praise and in their description, “They are those who do not pray to anyone besides Allah as the Lord and who do not destroy any soul that Allah has prohibited to destroy except for a truthful purpose, who do not commit fornication and those who do so have committed a sin. His punishment, on the Day of Judgment, will double and they live therein forever in humiliation. ”(24: 68-69) ‘He then has said that He has purchased from these believers their souls and those who possess likewise of their qualities, “Their souls and properties in exchange for paradise; They fight for the cause of Allah so they destroy the enemy and themselves become martyrs. It is a promise to them in all truth in the Torah, the bible and al-Quran.” He then has mentioned their standing by their promise and covenant and their pledging allegiance saying, “Who is more firm in his promise than Allah? Your deal of selling (your souls) is glad news for you and this is the great success.” (9:111) ‘When this verse (9:111) was revealed a man stood up before the Holy Prophet and said, “O Holy Prophet of Allah, do you think, a man who takes up his sword and fights until he is killed, is considered a martyr?” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then revealed the following verse to His prophet, “The repenting, those who praise (Allah) who fast, perform Ruku’ and Sajdah, who command people to do good and prohibit them from committing evil, who protect the laws of Allah, (you can) give glad news to the believing people.” (9:112) The Holy Prophet, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then interpreted it as a reference to those of the believers who possess such qualities and praise as martyrs deserving paradise. He said that it means repenting from sins, the worshippers who worship only Allah without considering anything as His partner. Praising (Allah) are those who praise Allah in all conditions; in hardships and in ease. Sa’ihun are those who fast. Performing Ruku ’ and Sajdah are those who regularly perform their five times’ daily Salat (prayer), who protect them and safe guard Ruku’, Sajdah in proper humbleness in their proper times. They thereafter command people to do good and prohibit from committing evil and themselves stay away there-from. He said, “Give glad news of paradise and martyrdom to those who are killed while they stand by these conditions.” He, the most Blessed, the most High, then has informed that He has not commanded anyone who does not possess these qualities to do Jihad. ‘He, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, said, “Those who are subjected to injustice are given permission to fight and Allah has the power to help them, those who are expelled from their towns without any good reason, except their saying that Allah is our Lord.” (22:39-40) ‘This is because everything between the earth and the sky belongs to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, His Messenger and their believing followers who have these qualities. Whatever of the worldly things exist in the hands of the pagans, unbelievers, unjust people and sinful people of those opposing the Messenger of Allah and who turn to disobey them, whatever is found in their hands is because of their doing injustice to the believers who possess those qualities. They have suppressed them (the believers) in matters of what Allah has returned (granted) to His Messenger. Thus, it is of their (believers’) rights that Allah has returned to them as Fay ’. The meaning of al-Fay’ is whatever goes in the hands of the pagans and then returns whatever, through their suppression of others, they had taken. So whatever of words or deeds returns back to its place is in the condition of al-Fay’ as it is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Those who swear to stay away from their women must wait for four months but if they go back Allah is forgiving and merciful.” (2:226) The word “fa”u” signifies “to return”. He then has said, “If they decide to divorce, Allah is hearing and knowledgeable.” (2:227) He has also said, “If two groups of believing people fight each other you must arrange reconciliation between them. If one group rebels against the other you must fight the rebellious ones until they “tafi’u” (go back) to submit themselves to the command of Allah. If they submitted (returned) then arrange reconciliation between them with justice; Allah loves those who practice justice.” (49:10) He by his word “tafi’u” has meant “return”. This is proof that al-Fay’ is whatever returns to the place where it was or it belonged. It then is said about the sun when it declines toward the west, “fa” at al-Shams”. It is said so when the shadow of an object goes back to increase after decreasing. So also is what returns to the believing people from the unbelievers. It is so because of being of the rights of the believing people, which is returned to them after injustice was done to them by the unbelievers. Of such issues are His words, “Permission is granted to the fighters because of injustice done to them.” Believers in general do not qualify for such permission. Such permission is given to those believers who stand by the conditions of their faith and belief, which we already have described. This is because a believer does not have such permission unless injustice is done to him and he cannot be an oppressed one unless he is a believer. He cannot be a believer unless he stands by the stipulations of his belief and faith which Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has set upon the believers and those who do Jihad. When the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, are accomplished in him, he becomes a believer. When he is considered a believer he is oppressed and when he becomes oppressed, permission is given to him to do Jihad because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Permission to fight is given to them because of injustice done to them and Allah has the power to help them.” If he is not up to the stipulations of belief, he is unjust, and of those against whom doing Jihad is obligatory until he repents. He does not have permission to do Jihad or call to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious; he is not of the believers to whom injustice is done and to whom permission to fight is given in the al-Quran. When this verse, “permission to fight . . .” was revealed about Muhajirin (immigrants) who were expelled from Makkah, their homeland and their properties it became lawful, He made it lawful for them to fight.’” “I then said, ‘This was revealed about Muhajirin because of the injustice of the pagans of Makkah. On what basis did they fight Kisra’ and Qaysar (Persians and Romans) and others such as pagan Arab tribes?’ “He (the Imam) replied, ‘If permission to fight was given only because of the injustice done to them by the pagans of Makkah, they then had no reason to fight such multitudes like Kisra’, Qaysar and people other than the people of Makkah of the Arab tribes. This is because those who did injustice to them (al-Muhajirun) were not these people. Instead they were the people of Makkah who had expelled them (al-Muhajirun) from their homeland and had dispossessed them of their properties without good reason. If the verse applied only to al-Muhajirun who were oppressed by the people of Makkah, this verse would remain without any applicable effect to others thereafter al-together; no one of the oppressors and the oppressed would have existed anymore. The obligation mentioned in it would have been lifted entirely after those people; the oppressed and the oppressors would have ceased to exist. In fact, it is not the way you thought it was and not the way I mentioned either. However, al-Muhajirun were oppressed in two ways. People of Makkah oppressed them by expelling them from their homeland and dispossessed them of their properties. Thus, they fought them by the permission of Allah. Kisra’ and Qaysar and others besides such people as the Arab and non- Arab tribes who oppressed them by keeping what rightfully belonged to the believing people. They fought them by the permission of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in this matter. Based on the authority of this verse (22:39), the believing people of all times have the permission to fight. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, however, has given permission to the believing people who stand up to the stipulations which Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has described and fulfill the requirements they need to have in belief and Jihad. Whoever then stands up to such stipulations is a believer, an oppressed and has permission to do Jihad in the sense mentioned. Those otherwise are oppressors and are not oppressed ones. Such ones do not have the permission to fight, to prohibit from committing evil or command people to do good. It is because they are not qualified for such tasks and do not have the permission to call to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. He cannot do Jihad against people like his own-self or call to Allah. One against whom believing people are commanded to do Jihad is not the one who does Jihad; he is prohibited to do Jihad due to lack of qualification. Such people the like of whom is commanded to repent cannot call to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, call to the truth, command others to do good or prohibit others from committing evil. One about whom a command to command him to do good is issued or a command to prohibit him from committing evil is issued cannot prohibit others against evil. ‘Only those in whom the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, which He has described as the qualified ones among the companions of the Holy Prophet, are complete, are of the oppressed ones. They have the permission to do Jihad just as they (al-Muhajirun) were given permission for Jihad. This is because the commands of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, are the same for the earlier and later generations, unless there is good reason or cause. People of the past generation or those of the coming generations are the same in matters of prohibitions also. People of the earlier generation were held responsible for a duty and so also is true of the people of the later generations who will be held accountable like those before them. One who does not have the qualification of those believing people to whom Allah has given permission to do Jihad is not qualified to do Jihad and does not have permission to do so until his return to the stipulation of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, upon him. When the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, upon believing people and those who can do Jihad are found in him in complete form he then is one of those permitted to do Jihad. ‘A servant (of Allah) must maintain piety before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and must not allow himself to be deceived by wishes which Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has prohibited to cherish in the form of the false Ahadith against Allah. It is of the kind of Ahadith, which is falsified by the Holy Quran. It denounces them and the carriers of such Ahadith as well as the narrators. (A servant of Allah) must not act before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, upon a doubtful matter in which he is not excused. In matters of lives involved for the cause of Allah, there is no position that can come in the presence of Allah before such matter. It is the ultimate act in greatness of value. One must have control over his ownself. One must show to himself the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and examine it by means of the book of Allah; no one knows better about a person than his own self. If he finds it up to the stipulations of Allah in matters of Jihad, he then should proceed for Jihad. If he finds shortcomings he must reform them and make himself to stand up to what Allah has made obligatory upon him in the form of Jihad. Thereafter he must take steps for Jihad with a soul clean and cleansed of all filthy matters that come between him and his Jihad. We do not say to those who intend to do Jihad - and he is not up to what we described of the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, upon the believing people and those who do Jihad - we do not say to them, “You must not do Jihad.” However, we do say to them that we have taught you the stipulations that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has set upon the people of Jihad with whom He has made a deal and a contract of purchasing their souls and properties in exchange for paradise. ‘Therefore, one must reform the shortcomings that he finds in his self in matters of Allah’s stipulation. He must examine his soul in matters of the stipulations of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. If he finds that he is true to the stipulations and has completed them in himself, then he is of those whom Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has given permission to do Jihad. I swear by my life that there is Hadith about one who does not find his soul up to the stipulations of Allah. There is Hadith about one who instead finds his soul persisting in disobedience of Allah and in committing unlawful acts and in involvement in Jihad with confusion and ignorance and in acting against Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, ignorantly and on the basis of false Ahadith. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, gives victory to this religion through such people who has no share or interest in it. One must maintain piety before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and be cautious about becoming as one of them. It is explained to you and now you have no excuse for ignorance after explanation. There is no power without Allah. Allah is sufficient for us. With Him we place our trust and to Him is the destination.’” "

If they are a people who have not mobilized and had not fought, you can do nothing but to call them to Allah.’ The man said, ‘I called them to Allah. One of them accepted the call, affirmed al-Islam in his heart and lived as a Muslim but injustice was done to him in judgment, his honor was violated, his property taken and he was subjected to transgression. What is the solution when I was the one to call him to Allah?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Both of you deserve rewards in the matter. He is with you to shield your honor, protect your Qiblah (the sacred location), to defend your book and save your life.

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from ‘Umar ibn ‘Udhaynah from Zurarah from ‘Abd al-Karim ibn ‘Utbah al-Hashimiy who has said the following: “I was sitting in the presence of abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, in Makkah when a group of people of al-Mu‘tazilah among whom ‘Amr ibn ‘Ubayd was present as well as Wasil ibn ‘Ata’, Hafs ibn Salim Mawla’ ibn Hubayrah and people of their leaders came to visit. This happened during the time when al-Walid was killed and people of al-Sham had differences among them. They spoke (about the situation) a great deal with confusion and made it very lengthy. Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said to them, ‘You have spoken a great deal and it is excessive for me. Appoint someone from among yourselves to speak in favor of your arguments and make it short.’ They then appointed ‘Amr ibn ‘Ubayd for this task. He spoke assiduously and made it lengthy. Among other things he said, ‘People of al-Sham have killed their Caliph, and Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has struck one group against the other and has scattered their affairs. We have deliberated and found a man who has religion, reason, kindness, position and resource for Caliphate and he is Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Hassan. We then decided to gather around him to pledge allegiance, then come with him in public. Those who pledge allegiance with us will be of us and we will be for him. Those who stay away from us we will keep away from him. Those who plan against us we will do Jihad and plan against them because of their rebellion and their rejection to return them to the truth and the people of truth. We like to present this plan before you so you will also join us; we need a person like you. It is because of your position and the great number of your followers.’ When he finished, abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, asked, ‘Are you all of the same opinion as ‘Amr is?’ They replied, ‘Yes, we are of the same opinion.’ He (the Imam) then praised Allah and glorified Him; then asked Him to grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to His cause). He then said, ‘We become angry when Allah is disobeyed but when He is obeyed we become happy.’ ‘O ‘Amr, tell me if the nation will make you the person in charge of their affairs and give you authority without fighting and expenses and said to you, “Whomever you choose to be their ruler with authority is accepted by the nation.” Whom then would you choose for the nation?’ He replied, ‘I will make it Shura’ (to be decided by the Muslims). He (the Imam) asked, ‘To be decided by all Muslims?’ He replied, ‘Yes, by all Muslims.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Will it be decided by their scholars of law and good ones?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Will such people be of Quraysh and others?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Will they be of Arab and non-Arab?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘O ‘Amr tell me, do you love abu Bakr and ‘Umar or denounce them?’ He replied, ‘I love them.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘But you just opposed them. What do you all say?’ They replied, ‘We love them.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘O ‘Amr, were you to be a man who denounced the two of them, then it would have been permissible for him to oppose them. How can you love the two of them when you just opposed them? ‘Umar had made a covenant with abu Bakr on the basis of which he pledged allegiance to him and he did not counsel anyone else on the issue. Thereafter abu Bakr returned it to him (‘Umar) and did not counsel anyone in the issue. ‘Umar then formed a council of six members. He kept all of al-Muhajirun and al-Ansar out of this council except those six people from Quraysh. He made a will about the council to which, I think, neither you nor your friends agree because you make a Shura’ of all Muslims.’ He asked, ‘What did he do?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘He commanded Suhayb to lead Salat (prayer) for the people for three days and to consult the six people and no one else except the son of ‘Umar who consulted them but would have had have no say in their decision. He made a will and advised those of al-Muhajirun and al- Ansar in his presence to do this: “If three days pass before the council finish the task or pledge allegiance to a man, you must cut off the necks of all the members of the council. If four of them agree on a plan before three days pass but two of them oppose, you must cut off the necks of the two opposing members of the council.” Do you accept such a plan about the council that you like all Muslims to form?’ They replied, ‘No.’ “He (the Imam) said, ‘O ‘Amr, leave this aside. Suppose, I pledged allegiance to your friend to whom you call me and then the nation gathered around you and no two people disagreed with you about your plan. Then you marched against the pagans who reject al-Islam and do not pay taxes. Will there be enough knowledge with your friend or with you with which you can deal according to the traditions of the Messenger of Allah in the matters of the pagans and the war against them?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘What will you do?’ He replied, ‘We call them to al-Islam. If they refused we tell them to pay taxes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘What you will do if they will be Majus and not of the people of the book?’ He replied, ‘They are the same.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Are you telling me from al-Quran?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘What will you do if they were pagans of Arab people and of idol worshippers?’ He replied, ‘They are the same.’ He (the Imam) asked, ’Are you telling me from al-Quran?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked read this, ‘Fight against those people of the Book who have no faith in Allah or the Day of Judgment, who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful, and who do not believe in the true religion, until they humbly pay tax with their own hands.” (9:29)’ “He (the Imam) asked, ‘Is the exception and the stipulation of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, about the people of the book and those not of the people of the book the same?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘From whom have you learned this answer?’ He replied, ‘I have heard people say so.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Leave this aside. Suppose they refuse to pay taxes and you fight them, and defeat them, then how will you deal with the properties captured from them?’ He replied, ‘I will deduct one-fifth from it and divide the remainder among those who have fought the war.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Tell me about the one-fifth. To whom will you give it?’ He replied, ‘I will give it to whomever Allah has told to give.’ The narrator has said that ‘Amr then recited: ‘You must take notice that whatever you gain one-fifth of it belongs to Allah, the Messenger, the relatives, the orphans, the destitute and those who deplete their expenses on a journey.’ (8:41) He (the Imam) asked, ‘To who will you give that which is for the Messenger?’ Who are relatives?’ He replied, ‘The scholars of the law have different opinions about it. Certain ones among them say, “They are the relatives of the Holy Prophet and his family.” Certain others say, “It is the caliph.” Still others say, “They are the relatives of those who have taken part in the fighting.’” He (the Imam) asked, ‘Which one do you think is it?’ He replied, ‘I do not know.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘I can see that you do not know. Leave this aside.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Consider the remainder after taking one-fifth. Will you distribute it among all the fighters?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘In doing so you oppose the Messenger of Allah. The decisive factor between you and I is the scholars of the law of al-Madinah and the elders. Ask them. They have no differences on this issue. They do not dispute that the Messenger of Allah made a truce with the Arabs. It said that they can live in their locations and must not migrate. If the enemy will attack him they must rise and fight his enemy but they will have no share in the properties captured from the enemy. You, however, say you will distribute it among all the fighters. In so doing you oppose the Messenger of Allah in his dealings in everything that you have said about the pagans. Despite this what do you say about charity?’ He (the Imam) then recited the verse to him. ‘Charity is for the poor, the destitute, the charity collectors. . . .’ (9:60) He said, ‘That is right.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘How will you distribute it?’ He replied, ‘I will divide it into eight portions and give to each category one portion thereof.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Will you do so even if members of one category will be ten thousand and of the members of another category there will be only one or two or three individuals present?’ Will you give to one individual an amount equal to what will you give to ten thousand people?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘Will you collect the charities of the towns and the city in one place and divide among them in equal portions?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘In doing so you oppose the Messenger of Allah in all of his dealings I have mentioned. The Messenger of Allah would give the charities of the people of the towns to the people of the towns and the charities of the people of the city to the people of the city. He would not distribute it among them in equal portions. He distributed it among them according to the number of people present and according to his discretion. He did not set about it a particular time or portion. He, according to the needs of the people present, distributed the charities. If you have doubts about what I said you can meet the scholars of the law of al-Madinah. They have no differences on the issue that the Messenger of Allah would do as I said he did.’ He (the Imam) then turned to ‘Amr ibn ‘Ubayd and said, ‘You in this group must maintain piety before Allah. You must maintain piety before Allah. My father was the best of the people on earth. He was more knowledgeable than all of the people on earth about the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and the tradition of the Messenger of Allah. He has said, “The Messenger of Allah has said, ‘Whoever strikes people with his sword and calls them to himself while among the Muslims there is someone more knowledgeable than he is, such person is lost and he is a pretender.””” "

The Muslims do not have to pay any compensation to anyone or ransom.’ “I also asked him, ‘Why is it that women do not have to pay taxes?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is because the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, prohibited fighting women and children in the war zone unless they fight. If women fight, one must cease fire as far as possible and there is no fear of a breach. Since he prohibited fighting in the war zone, in the peace zone (Islamic domain) it certainly is forbidden. If she refuses to pay taxes, destroying her is not possible and when destroying her is not possible there is no tax on her to pay. If men refuse to pay taxes, they will be in breach of the covenant and it is lawful to eliminate them; elimination of men is lawful in pagans’ lands.

He then said, ‘Mobilize in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight those who reject belief in Allah. You must not betray, or deceive, you must not deform anyone, you must not kill children, you must not kill devoted worshippers who live in desolate places, you must not burn palm trees or flood them in water, you must not cut down fruit-bearing trees, you must not burn down farms because you do not know who will use them for food. When you meet an enemy of the Muslims, give him three choices. If he accepts you also must accept it from him and allow him to live free. Call them to al-Islam. If they accept you must also accept it (their acceptance) and allow them to live free; or ask them to migrate (to the land under the Islamic domain) after their accepting al-Islam. If they accepted you must also accept it from them and allow them to live free. If they refuse migration but choose to remain in their land and refuse to move to migration locations, they are considered as the believing Arabs. Whatever applied to believing Arabs apply to them. They will have no share in al- Fai ’ and any dividend until they move in the way of Allah. If they refuse to accept both of the previous choices, then ask them to pay taxes with their own hands in a humble manner. If they agree to pay taxes then you must accept it from them and allow them to be free. If they refuse all the choices, then ask assistance from Allah and do Jihad against them in the way Jihad must be performed. If the residents of the stronghold are surrounded and they propose that they are ready to accept the laws of Allah in the matter, do not accept their proposal. Ask them to accept your decision in the matter. Thereafter make your decision the way you want. If you leave them according to the laws of Allah, you will not be able to find if you have found Allah’s applicable law in the matter or not. When you surround the residents of a stronghold and they ask you to deal with them upon the responsibility of Allah and the responsibility of His Messenger, you must not agree with such a proposal. In fact you must deal with them upon your own responsibility and the responsibility of your fathers and brothers. It is easier for you if you could not keep up with your responsibility and the responsibility of your fathers and brothers, than your failure to keep up with the responsibility of Allah and His Messenger ‘Alayhi al-Salam.’” "

It was made obligatory for the believing people. The unbelievers found out when they were asked, “What has led to Saqar?” (74:46) They replied, “We were not of those who performed Salat (prayer).” The believing people who do not become disturbed because of worldly attractions, delightfulness of their eyes because of wealth and children realize its significance and know its proper time to be performed and think of it as very graceful. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “There are men who do not become disturbed because of business and trade when they speak of Allah and performing Salat (prayer).” The Messenger of Allah after receiving the glad news of paradise had fixed himself in performing Salat (prayer). Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Command your family to perform Salat (prayer) and exercise patience during Salat (prayer).” (20:132) ‘He would command his family to perform Salat (prayer) and himself would exercise patience during performing Salat (prayer). Thereafter Zakat along with Salat (prayer) is made a means of getting nearer to Allah for the people of al-Islam and upon the people of al-Islam. One who does not perform it with his soul delighted and then expects to receive a reward better than Salat (prayer) he is ignorant of the Sunnah, suffers loss in matters of his reward and his life ends in confusion. He remains regretful because of disregarding the command of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and not paying attention to what the virtuous servants of Allah had great inclinations. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “We turn away whoever follows a path other than that of the believing people, to whatever he loves.” (4:115) ‘Thereafter is keeping of trust. One who is not a person of trust suffers a great loss and his deeds become confused. It was introduced to the well established heavens, well stretched earth and well fixed mountains. Other things are not taller, wider, higher and greater than them. If tallness, wideness, greatness, power and majesty were needed to refuse they could use them. They feared punishment, thus refused to accept the trust. Thereafter is Jihad. It is the noblest one of the deeds after al-Islam. It is the pillar of religion. The reward for it is great with majesty and highness. It is an opportunity in which there is goodness and glad news of paradise after martyrdom and sustenance with the Lord and honor. ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “You must not think of those who are murdered for the cause of Allah as dead. . . .” (3:169) Fear and fright of doing Jihad, when there is demand for Jihad, and supporting to cause confusion is straying in religion, losses in the worldly matters, humiliation and lowliness. In it there is reason to deserve hellfire because of fleeing during advancing against the enemy and fighting. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “O believers, when you face the unbelievers during and advancing against the enemy you must not turn your backs to them.” (8: 15) ‘You must observe the commandments of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in such conditions and exercise patience therein. It is honor, salvation and safety in this world and in the next world, which is full of frightening matters and fear. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, is not concerned about what the servant commits during the nights and days although His knowledge of their activities is subtle. All of these are in the book. My Lord does not become confused and forget. You must exercise patience, encourage others to exercise patience and ask Allah for help.

Launch your spears, they move swiftly. Look with a lower angle; it ties down excitement and relaxes the heart. Silence voices; it keeps failure away and it is better for dignity. You must not allow your banners to incline and you must not remove them. You must not allow anyone other than brave people to carry them. The defenders of what is very important, who can exercise patience in difficult conditions, deserve to be the protectors. You must not mutilate those who are killed, and when you reach the men of the enemy you must not expose privacies, you must not enter any house, you must not take anything of their properties except what you find with their army. You must not disturb any woman with mistreatment; and if they use bad words against your honor, men, virtuous ones among you, it is because they suffer from physical, psychological and intellectual weakness. We were ordered to hold our hands back from them and they were pagan women. If a man would take upon women this would remain a flaw in him and in his descendants after him. You must take notice, people capable of protecting important matters deserve to carry the banner to provide it protection and others walk on the sides, behind and in front of them, and they must not lose sight of it (the banner) and must not remain far behind nor must they go far ahead to become separated. I pray to Allah to grant blessings to one who cooperates with his brother (in faith) with his person. One should not leave his peer against his brother so that his peer and his brother fight. This brings regret and humiliation. This inevitably becomes his (enemy’s) fight against two people if he holds his hands back and has left his peer alone against his brother and has run away. He just looks to him and this one. If one does it he has angered Allah. You must not expose yourselves to the anger of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. “Running away does not benefit you even if you run away from death, or from being killed, because thereafter you will not benefit more than very little.” (33:16) I swear by Allah, if you run away from the swords nearby, you will not escape from the swords later on. You must seek help by exercising patience and truthfulness. Victory comes only after exercising patience. You must do Jihad for the cause of Allah, the way Jihad should be done and there is no power without Allah.’ “He (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, passed by the banner of the people of al-Sham and found them holding their position. He said, ‘They will not move from their position without a blow which is hard and expels the soul out, and a blow that splits the skull, crushes the bones and makes the arms and the hands to fall off so that their forehead is crushed by the iron bars, their eyebrows scatter over their chest and chin. Where are people of patience and seekers of reward?’ A group of the Muslims marched to them. The right flank of this group returned back to the center and exposed those opposite to them. He, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, moved forward until he reached them and said, ‘I saw your attack and retreat away from your positioned lines. It was your moving that provided a chance for the unjust and tyrants of al-Sham. You are the top most among Arab and the great peak, the beauty of the nights because of your recitations of the Holy Quran and the callers from among the people of the truth, while the sinners are lost. Were it not for your advance after your retreat and your regrouping after giving way to the enemy, you could have become subject to what those fleeing from the enemy during an advancing operation need to face for turning their backs to the enemy. I would find you of those being destroyed. My concerns are to a small degree reduced and my chest to a small degree is comforted. This happened when I saw you gain the ground over them as they had against you and you were able to remove them from their positions as they had done to you. I saw you strike them with your sword until their first line was toppled over the last line like the camel driven away. You must exercise patience. Comfort has come upon you and Allah has made you steadfast with certainty, so that the defeated notice that he is making his Lord angry. He hates his own self. In fleeing from the battle there is the anger of Allah, the inevitable humiliation, and a remaining stigma and destruction of ways of one’s living. There is no increase in the longevity of life of the fleeing person, no barrier between him and his day of death, and his Lord does not become happy with him. One’s death with truthfulness before achieving such characteristics is better than remaining with them and dwelling upon them.’ “In another of his speech he, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘When you face these people (the enemy) tomorrow do not fight them before they attack you. When they attack you then rise against them. You must remain calm and dignified. You must fix your backside teeth against the teeth of opposite side. It delivers a harder hit on the skulls. Keep your eyes lower and look at the foreheads of the horses and the faces of men. Reduce your speech; it keeps failure and argumentations away. You must settle your souls up facing the enemy openly, to advance and to attack. You must remain steadfast and speak of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, very often. One who protects what is important in difficult times is of the protecting people who keep their banner on the side and others walk on its sides and in front. When you attack do it with such coordination as if it is one man’s attack. You must be protective; war is bitter. You must not allow them (enemy) to attack you after retreat or to advance to you after an unpredictable move. If one surrenders, accept it from him. Seek help from exercising patience; victory from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, follows exercising patience. Allah’s servants will inherit the earth and the good end belongs to those who maintain piety before Allah.’” "

The Arabs do not have any share in the properties captured in the war even if they are of the fighters alongside the Imam. It is because the Messenger of Allah had made a treaty with them which said that they can live in their land and do not migrate.

Abu Qatadah said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, the enemy has turned back; if you consider it proper allow us to race our horses for a contest.’ He said, ‘That is fine.’ They raced and the Messenger of Allah became the winner among them.

They worship and perform rituals as youngsters with insufficient understanding and dimwittedness. They do not deem asking others to do good and prohibiting evil as necessary unless doing so is totally harmless for them. They seek for themselves permissions and excuses and follow the mistakes of the scholars and their invalid deeds. They go for Salat (prayer) and fasting and things that do not affect them in matters of their lives and properties. If performing Salat (prayer) would affect their other activities about their properties and persons, they disregard it just as they disregard highest quality obligations and the noblest ones. ‘Asking people to do good and to prohibit them from committing evil is a great obligation by which responsibilities are fulfilled. In such case the anger of Allah, the most Majestic, the most Glorious, becomes complete upon them. His torment encompasses them; thus, even virtuous people are destroyed in the location of the sinful ones and the children along with the grown-up ones. Asking others to do good and prohibiting them from evil is the path of the prophets and the method of the virtuous ones. It is a great responsibility with which obligations are fulfilled and religions are protected, earnings become lawful, usurped properties are retrieved, the land is developed, justice is made available for even the enemies and the matters are kept upright. You must then dislike evil in your hearts, reject it with your tongues, strike it against their faces and do not fear anyone’s blames in matters about Allah. If people committing evil accepted your advice and returned to the truth then that is fine. “Blameworthy are those who do injustice to people and rebel in the land without any truthful cause, for them there will be painful punishment.” (42: 42) Against such people you must fight with your person and hate them in your hearts without wanting domination, gaining properties or victory through injustice. You must continue until they come to the command of Allah and to obey Him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Allah, the most Majestic, the most Glorious, sent revelation to prophet Shu’ayb ‘Alayhi al-Salam, “I want to punish one hundred thousand people from your followers, forty thousand of the evil doers and sixty thousand of the good ones.” He asked, “O Lord, these are the evil doers but what about the good ones?” Allah, the most Majestic, the most Glorious, sent him revelation that said, “They stopped giving the good advice to the evil doers and did not become angry because of My becoming angry with them.’”” "

He first praised and glorified Allah. Thereafter he said, ‘People before were destroyed because when they committed sins the Rabbis and Monks did not stop them from committing such deeds. When they continued committing disobedience and the Rabbis and Monks did not prohibit them, torments descended upon them. They then commanded others to do good and prohibited to commit evil, they found this did not make the time of their death closer and nor did it reduce their sustenance. The command comes from the sky to the earth, like the drops of rain, to everyone as Allah measures for it (soul) in matters of increase and reduction. If one of you is affected in matters of family, property or life and finds all such things with his brother in abundance, it should not become matters of trial for him. A Muslim is free of all forms of treachery as long as acts of lowliness do not take place from him (through his hands), about the mention of which he remains fearful. On the other hand, people of lowly manners remain interested in lowly acts like a gambler who waits for the hit by the first winning arrow which brings him gains and fends off from him the loss. The Muslim who is free of treachery expects from Allah, the most High, one of the two forms of gains. It is either the call from Allah, thus what is with Allah for him is better, or sustenance from Allah. So he has a family, property with religion and valuable status. Wealth and children are worldly plantations but good deeds are plantations for the next life. At certain times Allah places both of them together for certain people. You must remain anxious about your relationship with Allah just as He has told you to be anxious about such relationship. You must worry, without shortcomings and about your status before Him. You must act without showing off and seeking popularity; those who act for something other than Allah, He leaves him to the one for whom he has acted. I pray to Allah to lead us to the destinations of the martyrs, living of those who have gained salvation and the company of the prophets (of Allah).”’ "

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Harun ibn Muslim Mas’adah ibn Sadaqah who has said the following: “Once, Sufyan al-Thawriy visited abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He saw the Imam wearing a cloth that was pure white like the membrane between an egg shell and its contents. He then said to the Imam, ‘This is not the kind of cloth you should wear.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Listen to me and pay proper attention to what I say; it is good for you now and in future if you like to die following the Sunnah and truth and not in heresy. I can tell you that the Messenger of Allah lived at a time when poverty was rampant. When living conditions improve the people most deserving to benefit from the worldly facilities are the virtuous people and not the sinful ones, the believing people and not the hypocrites, the Muslims and not those who reject Islam. What then is it that you, O Thawriy, dislike? When you see me in this condition, you must take notice that, I swear by Allah, from the time I reached the age of maturity, there has never been an evening or morning when Allah had a right in my properties that He had commanded me to payoff and I had not already paid it off.’ He (the narrator) has said that then a group of people who showed themselves to people to be abstaining from the worldly matters and called people to become like them in treating their bodies with harshness said to the Imam, ‘Our fellow companion has become tonguetied before you and is unable to present his argument properly.’ He (the Imam) then asked them, ‘What is the argument that you think you have?’ They replied, ‘It is from the book of Allah.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘You then must present it; it is the most rightful fact to follow and upon which one must act.’ They said, ‘Allah, most Blessed, most High, speaking of a group of people of the companions of the Holy Prophet has said, “They give preference to others over their own-selves even though they particularly are in need of what they give away to the needy. Whoever controls the greed of his soul is of those who find true happiness.” (59:10) He has praised their deeds and in another passage He has said, “They offer food for His love to the destitute, the orphan and captives. . . .” (76:8) We think this much from the Holy Quran is enough to support our argument.’ A man from among the people present then said, ‘We know that you abstain from good food but at the same time ask people to give away from their properties so that you in turn benefit from such properties given away.’ “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘You should leave alone the matters that do not benefit you. You however must tell me this. Do you have the knowledge of the abrogating and abrogated matters of the Holy Quran; what are the unequivocal and ambiguous matters in which strayed those who strayed and faced destruction, those who were doomed to face destruction of the members of this nation?’ They or certain ones among them replied, ‘We do not know all of such matters.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘This is where you have difficulties. The same case applies to Ahadith of the Messenger of Allah. However, what you mentioned of the matters that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has spoken to us in His book about a people and their good deeds, you must take notice, such deeds were permissible and lawful. It was not prohibited for them, and their reward for such deeds is with Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious. (It was not obligatory on them) because Allah, most Holy, has commanded to do what is opposite to what they had done. Therefore, His prohibition was abrogating their practice; Allah, most Blessed, most High, out of His mercy toward the believing people, stopped them from harming themselves, their dependents, the weak ones, the small ones like children, the old men and women who are not able to bear hunger. If the loaf of my bread is given away while I have no other loaf of bread, then the lives of such ones (of my dependents) are jeopardized because of hunger. For this reason the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, has said, “If one has five dates in his possession or five loaves and he wants to give charity, the best charity to give is to spend it on one’s parents, then on his own self and dependents, thirdly on his relatives, fourthly on his neighbors, fifthly he should spend it in the way of Allah which is of the lowest degree of rewards.” The Messenger of Allah once, when one of the people of al-Ansar at the time of his death had set free five or six of his slaves and had no other possession and had left behind small children, said, “Had you informed me before about what he has done, I would not have given you permission to bury him in the graveyard of the Muslims due to his leaving behind small children with their hands spread before people for help.’” He (the Imam) then said, ‘My father has narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah has said, “Begin, when giving charity, with your dependents, the nearest ones first and so on.” Allah, most Majestic, most Wise, has also said, “. . . those who when giving charity do not exceed proper limits and nor do they act stringently, but give charity in a moderate manner.” (25:67) Is it not true that Allah, most Blessed, most High, has said what is other than what I see you call people to do and to give others preference over their own selves, while He has called what you want people to do as exceeding the proper limits in spending? In more than a verse of His book He says, “He does not love those who exceed proper limits in spending.” (6:141 and 7:31) He has prohibited from acting as exceeding proper limits in spending and acting very stringently. He has told them to act moderately in between the two manners of spending. One must not give away all of his belongings and then begin to pray to Allah to grant him sustenance. His prayer then is not answered as it is mentioned in a Hadith, narrated from the Holy Prophet, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, that says, “The prayers of certain individuals of my followers are not answered. Of such people is one who prays against his parents, one who prays against his debtor who borrowed money without writing down for the record and appointing two witnesses for what he has borrowed, one who prays against his wife when Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, in His laws has already authorized him to dissolve the contract of his marriage and one who sits at home without work, then prays to Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, for sustenance but does not go out to work for a living. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says to him, “My servant, have I not made ways for you to seek means of living and go around in the land by the help of your healthy bodily abilities so that you would not leave any excuse between Me and yourself in matters of your seeking to make a living and in obedience to My command and to avoid becoming a burden on your family? Now you have no excuse. I may grant you sustenance or make you suffer stringent conditions.” Another person is a wealthy one who spends all of his wealth and then begins to pray to Allah for his sustenance. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says, “Had I not given you a great wealth? Why did you not act moderately as I had commanded you to do and avoid exceeding the proper limits of spending manners? I had already prohibited you to do so.” Yet there is another person who prays against good relationships with his relatives. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, then taught his Prophet how to spend in charity. Once there were a few Awqiyyah (certain units of measurement) of gold and he did not like to keep them with him for the night while they are not given away to deserving people. So he gave them away and in the morning there was nothing left with him. A person came to him asking for help but he had nothing to give him. The person asking for help blamed him for his inability to provide any help and he became sad; nothing was left there with him to help and he was a very kindhearted person. Allah most High, disciplined His prophet, by means of commanding him, “You must not keep your hands tied up to your neck and you must not expand them altogether so much so that you then remain blamed and unable to provide any help.” (17:31) He says, “People ask you for help and they do not accept your excuses. If you give away all the properties you remain unable to help the needy.” These are of the Ahadith of the Messenger of Allah verified by the book which is confirmed by the believing people of the book. Abu Bakr at the time of his death, when asked to make a will, made a will about one-fifth of his legacy saying, “One-fifth is a great deal.” Allah, most High, has approved wills about one-fifth. So he made a will about one-fifth. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, had given the right to make a will about one-third of one’s legacy at the time of one’s death. If he knew that one-third is better for him he would have made a will for one-third. People other than abu Bakr, as you know their excellence and restraint from the worldly matters, were Salman and abu Dharr, may Allah be happy with them. Salman’s manners were such that whenever he received a gift he would keep aside one year’s expenses thereof until receiving his gift of the coming year. It was said to him, “O abu ‘ Abd Allah, why is it that with all the restraint you exercise in the worldly matters and you do not know whether you will die today or tomorrow, you still keep one year’s amount of your expenses aside from the gift you receive?” His answer was as follows, “Why do you not wish for me one more year of living instead of fearing for my death within a year?”’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘O ignorant people, have you not noticed that one’s soul becomes lazy and weak (in worship) when he does not have dependable means of living but when he gains his means of living his soul gains comfort. Abu Dharr owned camels and sheep. He would get milk from them and also use their meat for food whenever he wanted for his family and for his guests or for the people from whom he received water. Whenever he thought they desired he would slaughter for them a camel for food or of the sheep to satisfy their desire for meat. He would distribute the meat among them and himself would get one share without anything more than others. Who is more restraining from the worldly matters than these people? The Messenger of Allah has said about them all that he has said but he has not mentioned anything about their dispossessing themselves altogether of their belongings by giving away everything in charity, just as you command people to give away all of their belongings to give preference to others over themselves and families. ‘O people, you must take notice that I heard my father narrating from his ancestors, ‘Alayhim al- Salam, from the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, who one day said, “No other thing is as astonishing to me as the condition of a believing person. If his body is cut into pieces by scissors, it is because it is for his good and if everything between the east and west is made to become of his belongings is because it is for his good. Everything that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, does for him is for his good.” I like to know what I have said to you today had any effect on you or I increase my sayings. Have you not noticed that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, at the beginning of Islam had made it compulsory on the Muslims to fight each one against ten pagans without turning his back to the enemy and those who did so would have filled his seat with hellfire. He then changed their condition out of mercy and kindness to them and told them to fight each one of them against two men of the pagans. It was a measure of relief in favor of the believers from Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious. This was an abrogation of one Muslims’ fighting against ten pagans. ‘You should tell me about the judges who rule against one of you to pay the expenses of his wife. Are they unjust judges if the defendant said, “I am a zahid (one who restrains from worldly matters) and I do not possess anything?” If you said such judges are unjust people, Islam will call you unjust, and if you said they are judges of justice, then you have defeated yourselves. By what means will you reject the validity of the will that leaves more than one-third for the poor out of the legacy of a deceased? You must answer to me about this. If all people were Zuhhad (restraining from worldly matters) as you like them to be without needing anything from the worldly matters, then who would receive the charities, expiation for disregard of one’s swearing and vows and charities like Zakat of gold, silver, dates, raisin and other items subject to Zakat like camel, cow, sheep and other goods? If it were as you say that no one should keep anything of the worldly things but instead send it as his supplies for the next life even though he may urgently need such items, what you maintain is bad and you have made people to follow what you follow due to ignorance of the book of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet of Allah and his Ahadith (sayings) which are verified by the divinely revealed book, and you have rejected them due to your ignorance and your disregard of the unique passages of the Holy Quran, the explanation of abrogating and abrogated matters, the unequivocal and ambiguous, the command and prohibitions therein. You must tell me if you know about Sulayman (the prophet) son of Dawud ‘Alayhi al-Salam, when he asked Allah to give him a kingdom which no one after him would ever have. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, gave him such kingdom. He spoke the truth and acted thereupon. We do not find Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, blaming him for possessing such kingdom, neither any of the believing people have ever blamed him for possessing such a kingdom. Before him lived Dawud, the prophet with great kingdom and strong control. There is Joseph, the prophet, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, who said to the king of Egypt, “Appoint me a supervisor of the treasures of the land; I am a knowledgeable keeper.” (12:56) He became the person in charge of the kingdom of the king up to Yemen. People would come for food supplies to him during food shortages and famine. We do not find any one to blame him for it. Dhul Qarnayn was a servant of Allah who loved Allah and Allah loved him. He prepared for him means and made him to possess the east and west of the land. He spoke the truth and acted thereupon. We do not find any one to blame him for it. You people must discipline yourselves by the disciplines of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, for the believing people. Follow the commands and prohibitions of Allah, and leave alone what has become confusing for you and you have no knowledge thereof. Leave issues of knowledge to the people of knowledge; you will be rewarded and excused before Allah, most Blessed, most High. You must seek to learn the knowledge of abrogating and abrogated matters of the Holy Quran, its unequivocal and ambiguous matters thereof. You must learn what Allah has made lawful and what He has made unlawful. This takes you closer to Allah and farther from ignorance. You must leave alone ignorance to its people. People of ignorance are many and people of knowledge are fewer. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has said, “Over every person of knowledge there is one more knowledgeable. ” (12: 76)’” "

Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from ibn Jumhur from his father in a marfu’ manner who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that Amir al-Mu’minin, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, very often would say, ‘You must take notice with absolute certainty that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, does not allow a servant, no matter how intensely he strives, how great the kind of means he prepares, and no matter how numerously he suffers fatigue, to exceed the limit which He has mentioned in His book of wisdom. It does not change anything for a man, with his weakness and his little means, in reaching what is already assigned for him in the book of wisdom. O people, one’s wisdom does not increase a naqir (a certain unit of measurement) for him and one’s lack of understanding does not reduce anything against him. One who knows this and acts accordingly is the greatest of people to enjoy comfort in profit, and one who knows it but ignores to act accordingly does the biggest work to cause losses. There are many of those who are led to destruction in the process of receiving favors, and also there are many of those who are thought of among people as being deceived, but in reality receive favors. O you who strive hard, beware of your struggle, hold back your haste and wake up from the slumber of your unawareness. Think about what has come from Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, through the tongue of His Holy prophet. Preserve these seven letters; they are of the words of the people of reason and of the decisive issues in the book of wisdom. One cannot reach before Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, with the presence of any single of these habits in him: considering things as partners of Allah in the matters that Allah has made obligatory on him, quenching his anger by destruction of his soul, claiming to have done what in fact others have done, seeking success before a creature by means of a heretic act in his religion, enjoying people’s praising him for what he has not done, acting oppressively and conceitedly, and being of honorable position but speaking lies. O people, what is important for beasts is transgression, and what is important for animals is to eat, what is important for women is their men; and believing people are anxious, fearful and afraid. I pray to Allah to make us one of them (such believers).”’ "

The outgoing people informed them that no such merchandise was available in the city. They (people of the incoming caravan) made an agreement among themselves on oath not to sell their merchandise for less than a profit of one dinar for each dinar worth of merchandise. After taking possession of their belongings, they returned to al-Madinah and Musadif came to abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, with two bagfuls of dinars, each of which had a thousand dinars. He said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, this is the capital and this is the profit.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘This is a great deal of profit. However, what did you do with the merchandise?’ He (Musadif) told the story of their agreement on oath. He (the Imam) said, ‘Allah is free of all defects. Why do you make an agreement on oath against a Muslim people not to sell for less than a profit of one dinar for each dinar worth of merchandise?’ He (the Imam) then took the two bags and said, ‘This is my capital and we do not need this profit.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘O Musadif, settling with sword is easier than earning by lawful ways.’” "

        "englishText": "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his narrators whom he has mentioned the following: “Exchange of gold for gold, silver for silver by weight in equal quantities is balanced. One does not have preference over the other. Silver can be exchanged for gold and gold can be exchanged for silver as you like in a hand in hand transaction and it is not harmful but it is not lawful on credit. Gold and silver can be sold in exchange for other things which are exchanged by weighing or measuring or numbering in a hand in hand transaction, and on credit all of such deals are not harmful. Things exchanged by measure or weight which are of the same origin do not have any preference over the other in measuring or weighing. If they are of different origins and are of things measured, it is not harmful to exchange two for one in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. Things of different origin which are exchanged by weight can be exchanged two for one in a hand in hand deal but on credit is Makruh (detestable). The exchange of things measured for what is weighed is not harmful in a hand in hand deal and on credit as well. The exchange of things numbered and not measured or weighed is not harmful if it is two for one in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. “He (Ali ibn Ibrahim) has said that this is if the origin is the same. If the origin of things numbered is different, then, it is not harmful to exchange two for one in a hand in hand deal or on credit as well, it all is not harmful. The exchange of things numbered or not numbered for what is measured or weighed in a hand in hand transaction or on credit is not harmful at all. Of things of the same origin and measured or weighed if then something comes out that is not measured or weighed, it is not harmful to exchange them in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. It is because cotton and al-Kattan originally are weighed and its yarn is weighed but fabrics are not weighed so cotton has no preference over yarn and its origin is one; so it is not valid unless it is in equal quantities by the same weight. When fabric is made out of it then in a hand in hand deal it is valid. In the case of fabrics it is valid to exchange one cloth for two cloths even though its origin is one in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. If it is cotton and al-Kattan then it is not harmful to exchange two for one in a hand in hand deal and it is Makruh on credit. If it is fabric of cotton and al-Kattan, it is not harmful to exchange two for one in a hand in hand deal or on credit; both deals are permissible. It is not harmful to exchange cotton and al-Kattan for wool in a hand in hand deal and on credit. The exchange of things from animals is not harmful if it is two for one, even if of one origin, in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. If the animals are of different origins it is not harmful to exchange two for one in a hand and hand deal but it is Makruh on credit. If animals are exchanged for goods and you take delivery of animal and leave the goods on credit, it is not harmful. If you take delivery of the goods and leave the animal it is Makruh (detestable). It is not harmful if you sell the animal in exchange for animal in addition with dirham also or goods. If you take delivery of animal and leave dirham on credit or one house for two houses, one Jirib of land for two Jirib of land it is not harmful in a hand in hand deal but it is Makruh (detestable) on credit. “He (Ali ibn Ibrahim) has said, Tn the case of goods exchanged by measuring or weighing standard is the one which is common, not a special one, such as if a people measure meat and almonds it is not taken as standard because originally meat is weighed and almonds are counted in numbers. ”” (According to Mir’at al-‘Uqul the above is fatwa of Ali ibn Ibrahim or his Shaykhs which is very strange to happen from people like him) "

I left in search of my debtor and when I reached near the bridge of al-Kufah, I was informed that my debtor had gone to al-Nil. I then moved to al-Nil. When I went to al-Nil I was informed that my debtor had gone to Baghdad. I then followed him, found him and finalized whatever was between him and me and we returned to al-Kufah. Going and coming took me fifteen days. I informed the owner of the mule of my reasons for the delay. I wanted to make it a lawful deal and make him agree so I paid him fifteen dirham but he refused to accept it. We then agreed to go to abu Hanifah for judgment. I told my side of the story to him and the man also told his side of the story. He asked me, ‘What did you do to the mule?’ I replied, ‘I have returned it to him safely.’ He (owner) said, ‘Yes, after fifteen days.’ He asked, ‘What do you want from the man?’ He replied, ‘I want the rent for the mule which he kept for fifteen days.’ He said, ‘I do not see any such right in your favor because he rented it to Qasr ibn Hubayrah, and he then violated the agreement and rode it to al-Nil and to Baghdad, so he became responsible for the price of the mule and the rent became void. He then returned the mule safely to you and you have it in your possession so he is not responsible for rent.’ We came out of his office and the owner of mule kept saying, ‘To Allah we belong and to Him we all return.’ I felt sympathy for him because of the fatwa of abu Hanifah against him and I gave him something and asked him not to hold me responsible. I went for al-Hajj in that year and informed abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the fatwa of abu Hanifah. He (the Imam) said, ‘It is because of this kind of judgments that the sky stops sending water and the earth denies its blessings.’ I then asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, ‘What do you say about it?’ I say that you must pay him a similar rent that is charged for a mule from al-Kufah to al-Nil, a similar rent for a mule that is charged from al-Nil to Baghdad, a similar rent that is charged for a mule from Baghdad to al-Kufah. You must pay him.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I fed the mule with a cost of many dirhams so he must pay for the feed.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘No, because you usurped it.’ I then said, ‘What could happen if the mule died and was damaged, would he not hold me responsible?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, he could do so for the value of the mule on the day you went against the stipulation.’ I then asked, ‘What could happen if the mule became damaged, sustained injuries or so?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You would owe the price between healthy and damaged mule on the day you returned to him.’ I then asked, ‘Who could determine it?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You and he (owner of mule) could do so. Either he had to take an oath to confirm the value for which you were responsible. If he turned the oath to you, you then had to take an oath about the value and it became binding on him or the owner of the mule had to present testimony and witness to prove how much the value of the mule was when it was rented and it became binding upon you.’ I then said, ‘I gave him a certain amount of dirham, he agreed and made it lawful in my favor.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He agreed and made it lawful for you because of the fatwa of abu Hanifah, unjustly. However, you must go to him and inform him of my fatwa on this matter to see if he still agrees after knowing it, thereafter there will be nothing on you.’ Abu Wallad al-Hannat has said, ‘As soon as I returned I met al-Mukariy and informed him of the fatwa of abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and I said to him, “Now say what you want to say so I pay you.” He said, “I feel love for Ja’far ibn Muhammad in my heart and my heart says he has preference over the others. You do not owe me anything even though I love to return what I have taken from you, I still can do so.’”” "

The Messenger of Allah associated with him closely because of his alienation and nakedness and had assigned one Sa‘ of dates by the measure of the first Sa‘ food for him, clothed him with two pieces of sheets, commanded him to stay in Masjid and sleep there during the night. He lived that way as long as Allah wanted until the number of emigrants grew of those who accepted Islam of the poor people in al-Madinah and the Masjid became smaller and congested. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent revelation to His holy prophet, to clean the Masjid, move from it those who slept there in the night, commanded to block all doors that opened to the Masjid except the door of Ali and the door to the living-quarter of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam. Everyone after sexual relation and before Ghusl (bath) was barred from entering the Masjid, and no alien could sleep in the Masjid. So the Messenger of Allah commanded to blocking all doors that opened to the Masjid except the door of Ali, and allowed the door of the living-quarter of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, to remain as they were before.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, then commanded to build a canopy for the Muslims which was built and that was the platform or the edge. He (the Messenger of Allah) then commanded the emigrants and the poor ones to stay there for the night and days. They made it their home and gathered therein. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, would come to see them, bring for them wheat, dates, barley and raisins whenever available. The Muslims sympathized with them because the Messenger of Allah sympathized with them and spent their charity on them. The Messenger of Allah one day looked at Juwayabir with kindness and sympathy and said to him, “I wish you to get married with a woman to safeguard your chastity and receive help for your worldly affairs as well as those of the hereafter.” Juwayabir then said, “O Messenger of Allah, I pray to Allah to keep my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, who will want me? By Allah, I do not have any good position and social standing, or wealth, or physical beauty. No woman will ever pay attention to me.” The Messenger of Allah then said, “O Juwayabir, Allah by means of Islam has removed those who were called noble in pre-Islamic time of darkness and ignorance and has honored them with Islam. To those who did not have any social position before Islam, Allah has granted honor as well as to those who were considered low in the time of ignorance. With Islam He has removed the pride of the time of ignorance and people’s expressing pride because of tribes and strong genealogy. Today (we say) all people, white and black, those from Quraysh, Arab, non- Arab are all from Adam, and Adam was created by Allah from clay. The most beloved in the sight of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, on the Day of Judgment will be those who are most obedient to Him and most pious before Him. O Juwayabir, I do not see any of the Muslims as better than you except because of his being more pious and more obedient to Allah than you.’” He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘O Juwayabir, you must go to Ziyad ibn Labid; he is an honorable man of the tribe of Bayadah, due to social standards and say to him, “I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah to you and the Messenger of Allah says, ’You must give your daughter al-Dhalfa’ in marriage to Juwayabir.”” He (the Imam) said that Juwayabir left with the message from the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, to Ziyad ibn Labid when he was at home with a group from his people. Juwayabir asked permission. He was informed and permission was granted. He entered and offered his greeting of peace, then said, ‘I am a messenger from the Messenger of Allah to you for a certain issue: if you like I can convey it to you in private or if you want I can say it in public.’ He said, ‘Say it in public; it is an honor for me and a privilege.’ Juwayabir said, ‘The Messenger of Allah says to you, “You must give your daughter al-Dhalfa’ in marriage to Juwayabir.’” Ziyad then asked him, ‘Has the Messenger of Allah sent you with this?’ Juwayabir replied, ‘Yes, I never want to speak a lie against the Messenger of Allah.’ Ziyad said, ‘We do not give our young girls in marriage to anyone, unless he is a good match for us of the people of al-Ansar (people of al- Madinah); so you must go back, O Juwayabir, until I meet the Messenger of Allah and inform him of my excuse.’ Juwayabir returned back saying, ‘By Allah, this is not what the Quran is all about or Prophet Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, has appeared for it.’ Al-Dhalfa’, daughter of Ziyad in her living-quarter heard what Juwayabir said. She sent someone to her father to ask him to come to her room and he went to her. She asked, ‘What were the words that I heard you spoke to Juwayabir?’ He said to her, ‘He told me that the Messenger of Allah had sent him and he (the Messenger of Allah) said, “You must give your daughter, al-Dhalfa’ in marriage to Juwayabir.’” She then said, ‘By Allah Juwayabir cannot lie against the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, in his presence. You must now send a messenger to call him back.’ Ziyad sent a messenger to call Juwayabir and approached him and said. ‘O Juwayabir, you are welcome. You must not be worried and wait until I come back.’ Ziyad went to the Messenger of Allah and said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, Juwayabir has brought your message to me that says, “The Messenger of Allah commands you to give your daughter al-Dhalfa’ in marriage to Juwayabir.” I was not so soft speaking to him. We do not give our young women in marriage to anyone except to our match of al-Ansar (people of al-Madinah).’ The Messenger of Allah said to him, ‘O Ziyad, Juwayabir is a believing person. A believing man is a match of a believing woman. A Muslim is a match of a female Muslim. Therefore you must give her in marriage to him. O Ziyad, you must give her in marriage to him and you must not refuse.’ He (the Imam) said that Ziyad returned back to his home, went to his daughter and said to her what he had heard from the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, She said to him, ‘If you disobey the Messenger of Allah, you will become an unbeliever, so you must give in marriage to Juwayabir.’ Ziyad came out, held the hand of Juwayabir, took him before his people, gave her to him in marriage according to the tradition of Allah and the tradition of the Messenger of Allah and took responsibility of mahr (dower). He (the Imam) has said, ‘They prepared al-Dhalfa’ for her wedding, sent for Juwayabir and asked him, ‘Do you have any house so we escort her to your house?’ he replied, ‘No, by Allah, I do not have any house.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘They prepared her for her wedding, prepared for them a house, furnishings, household necessities, dressed Juwayabir with two dresses, brought al-Dhalfa’ to her house, and admitted Juwayabir also there. Juwayabir went in the house after al-‘Isha’ Salat (prayer). He looked at the house, the furnishings, the sweet smelling fragrance, thus, he moved to a corner of the house and began to recite from the Quran, in Ruku’ (bowing down on one’s knees) and in Sajdah (prostration) until it was dawn. He heard the call for Salat (prayer), so he went out for Salat (prayer) as well as his wife. She made wudu and performed Salat (prayer) of the morning and she was asked about being touched. She replied, ‘He continued reciting the Quran in Ruku ’ and Sajdah until the call for Salat (prayer) was said then he went out.’ In the second night he did just as he had done the night before but they did not tell it to Ziyad. In the third night he again did as he had done before, then her father was informed. He went to the Messenger of Allah and said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, O Messenger of Allah, you commanded me to give my daughter in marriage to Juwayabir and by Allah we did not want to do so; but obedience to you made it necessary on us to do so.’ The Holy Prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, asked, ‘What is it that you disliked about him?’ he replied, ‘We prepared a house for him with furnishings, household necessities, sent my daughter to that house, he also was admitted there after al- ‘Isha ’ Salat (prayer) but he did not speak to her, did not look at her and did not go close to her, instead he stood in one corner of the house, continued reciting al-Quran, in Ruku’ and Sajdah (prostration) until the call for Salat (prayer) was said. He went out for Salat (prayer); he did it again in the second, and in the third nights. He did not go close to her and did not speak to her until the time of my coming to you. We did not find him to be interested in women. Please look into our problem.’ Ziyad went back and the Messenger of Allah sent for Juwayabir and asked him, ‘Is it the case that you do not go close to women?’ Juwayabir replied, ‘A male person I am O Messenger of Allah and I indeed have intense desire and passion for women.’ The Messenger of Allah said, to him, ‘I am informed otherwise about what you are telling to me. I am told that they prepared for you a house, furnishings, the necessities of a household and she was brought to you in that house, a beautiful young woman and rich with sweet smelling perfumes. You went after performing your al-‘Isha ’ Salat (prayer) but did not look at her, did not speak to her, and did not go close to her. What was your wisdom in it?’ Juwayabir replied, ‘O Messenger of Allah, when I entered the vast house, saw the furnishings, the household necessities, the young beautiful girl, rich in sweet smelling perfumes, remembered my condition in which I lived, my alienation, my poverty, and lowliness, my clothes with the emigrants and the destitute people; I then loved at first to thank Allah for what He had given to me and tried to become closer to Him. I then went to one corner of the house and continued in Salat (prayer) reciting al-Quran in Ruku ’ (bowing down on one’s knees) and Sajdah (prostration) thanking Allah until I heard the call for Salat (prayer), then I went out. In the day I decided to fast that day and did so for three days and nights and I thought to do that for what Allah had given to me although my thanks were very little, however, I will make her happy and make them happy tonight, by the will of Allah.’ The Messenger of Allah then sent a message to Ziyad who came to the Messenger of Allah and he (the Messenger of Allah) informed him about Juwayabir. They became delighted. Juwayabir kept his promise. Thereafter, the Messenger of Allah went out for an armed expedition, Juwayabir was with him and he became a martyr, may Allah, most High grant him mercy. In the community of al-Ansar (people of al-Madinah) there was no single woman in such a great demand than her (al-Dhalfa’) after Juwayabir.’” "

The pagans, like Arab pagans or others live with their marriage until the time the waiting period is complete. If the woman becomes a Muslimah then the man becomes a Muslim before the waiting period is over. She remains his wife; but if he did not become a Muslim before the waiting period is complete then she becomes stranger for him and he cannot approach her. This applies to all non-tax payers.

Those who cannot provide expenses for one they can marry slave-girls whom they own. If one cannot maintain women, marry free women or buy a slave-girl; Allah has made al-Mut‘ah lawful by means of whatever is easy of mahr (dower) to pay in which providing maintenance and all expenses is not necessary. Allah makes each one self-sufficient by means of whatever He has given them in the form of their abilities to pay mahr (dower) with (or without) constraint in expenses for maintenance and the ability to refrain from indecent activities and the ability to refrain. From Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, are good resources, capabilities and guidance to lawful goals by means of what He has given them so they can maintain chastity, remain away from unlawful matters by means of what He has given them and has made them free of needing unlawful matters and by whatever He has given them and has explained to them. Thus He has set limits upon them, like punishment by lashing and stoning, Li ‘an (condemnation) and separation. Had Allah not met the needs of each group by the resources that are made available to them and the lawful ways He would not set any of such limitation upon them. “The permanent manner of marriage and owning slave-girls are well-known among people because of being practiced so often. The issue of al-Mut‘ah is not clear for many people because of the prohibition of the One who prohibited it even though permission for it exists in the revelation (al- Quran) and is mentioned in the universal Sunnah for those who may like to find the reason and like to know it. Marriage in the manner of al-Mut‘ah is permissible for rich and poor with equal measure of lawfulness of marriage as they are equal in completing the obligation of al-Hajj and al-Mut‘ah in al- Hajj. The offering animal is for both rich and poor to offer. In this respect rich and poor are equal. It is because obligatory matters are sanctioned on the basis of the ability of those with the least amount of abilities to include both rich and poor. It is not fair to sanction obligatory matters on the basis of the abilities of people, otherwise, weakness and strength become confused. They are sanctioned on the basis of the least amount of abilities, thereafter the stronger ones are exhorted to compete in good deeds in optional matters because of their strength in their persons and wealth. Al-Mut‘ah is lawful for rich and poor, for those with limited abilities and for those with four wives or those who are married with slave-girls, if one likes. It is lawful for those who can only find enough for mahr (dower) of al- Mut‘ah and mahr (dower) is whatever they agree on within the limits of marriage for rich and poor regardless of being very little or a great deal.’” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘The boy has sinned as well as his mother and it is not permissible for the father, after his son’s going near her, to fall on her.’ I then asked him (the Imam) about the case of a man who has a slave-girl and his father places his hand on her with lust or looks where it is not permissible to look with lust.

A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from Muhammad ibn Sa‘id who has said, that informed me Zakariya ibn Muhammad from his father from ‘Amr who has said the following: “Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘People of Lot were of the excellent people Allah had created. Iblis persuaded them very intensely. Due to their excellent manners, they would go to work together in groups and leave women behind at home. Iblis (Satan) would come to them every day and in their absence Iblis (Satan) would destroy their work accomplished in a day. One of them suggested keeping watch and seeing who destroys their work accomplished. They remained on their guard and found him out to be a very good looking boy. They said, ‘So it is you who destroys our work every time.’ They decided to kill him. They left him with a man for the night. During the night he cried and the man asked, ’What is the matter?’ He replied, ‘My father would allow me to sleep on his belly.’ The man said, ‘Fine, come and sleep on my belly.’ He (the boy) began to mb the man until he taught him how to engage in anal sexual intercourse with him. The first to teach the indecent act was Iblis (Satan) and the second was this man. He then ran away and in the morning the man told everyone about what he had experienced with the boy and they liked it. They did not know it (the indecent act) before. They learned it and man began to practice the indecent act with another man. Thereafter, they even ambushed by-passers and engaged with them in the indecent act until their city failed the people. They neglected their women and turned to young boys. When he, Iblis (Satan), found out that his plan has worked and it has become strong among men he then turned to women in the form of a woman and said, ‘Your men engage in sexual intercourse with each other.’ They replied, ‘Yes, we know it.’ Lot all the time preached to them against it and Iblis (Satan) deceived them until women totally turned to women and men turned to men for sexual satisfaction. When Allah’s point was established against them He sent Jibril, Michael and Israfil (three angels) in the form of young boys wearing gowns. They passed by Lot who was tilling the land. He asked, ‘Where do you want to go? I have never seen any boys more beautiful than you.’ They replied, ‘Our master has sent us to the chief of this city.’ He then asked, ‘Is your master not informed that the people of this city commit indecent acts? O my sons, they by Allah take men and engage in anal sexual intercourse with them until they make them bleed.’ They said, ‘Our master has commanded us to pass through their middle.’ He then said, ‘I have one wish before you.’ They asked, ‘What is your wish?’ He replied, ‘You wait here until it is dark.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘They waited.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He sent his daughter to bring them bread, water in a water-sack, and a gown for cover against cold. When his daughter went rain came in the valley and Lot said that now flood washes away the children thus, (you must) get up so we can move away to seek shelter of the wall. So Jibril, Michael and Israfil began to walk in the middle of the road. He said, ‘Children, walk here.’ They replied, ‘Our master has commanded us to walk in their middle.’ Lot was trying to benefit from the darkness. Iblis (Satan) took a child from the arms of a woman and threw him in a well and all people of the city came at the door of Lot for help. When they saw the young boys in his home they said, ‘O Lot, this proves that you also do what we do’ He said, ‘They are my guests so you must not disgrace me about my guests.’ They said, ‘There are three of them. Take one and give two of them to us.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He took them inside a room and said, ‘I wish I had a family to defend me against you.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The crowd began to press at the door, broke through the door of Lot and flattened Lot on the ground. Jibril said, ‘We are the messengers of your Lord and they cannot reach you.’ He took a handful of soil from Batha’ and threw it against their faces and said, ‘Ugly faces.’ All people of the city became blind.’ Lot said, ‘O messengers of my Lord, what has my Lord commanded you to do about them?’ They replied, ‘He has commanded us to seize them in the morning.’ He said, ‘I have one wish before you.’ They asked, ‘What is your wish?’ He replied, ‘I request you to seize them now because I am afraid bada’ (change of plan) may take place with my Lord.’ They said, ‘O Lot, the appointed time for them is the morning, is not the morning very near, for one who wants to seize them? Take your daughters and move away but depart your wife.’” “Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘May Allah grant mercy to Lot! If he knew who were with him in the room he would become certain of his victory when he said, ‘I wish I had power against you or a strong support’, what kind of support is stronger than Jibril who was in the room with him? Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, said, to Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, “ . . . from the unjust it is not far away,” from the unjust ones in your followers if they do what people of Lot did.’ He (the Imam) said that the Messenger of Allah has said, ‘One who insists in engaging for anal sexual intercourse with men will not die before calling men to engage in anal sexual intercourse with him.”’ "

They visited Ibrahim ‘Alayhi al-Salam wearing turbans on them. They offered him Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) but he could not recognize them, and he found them in a very good appearance and said, ‘No one will serve them other than myself.’ Ibrahim liked serving guests very much; so he prepared for them and roasted a very meaty calf. When it was ready, he served them and brought it for them, ‘He saw that their hands do not reach the food: he could not recognize them and he began to feel afraid of them’ but when Jibril noticed he removed the turban from his face and he (Ibrahim) recognized him and asked, ‘Are you he (jibril)?’ He replied, ‘Yes, I am he.’ His wife Sarah, passed by and he gave her the good news of the birth of Ishaq (Isaac) who will be succeeded by Ya’qub. She asked, ‘What has Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, said?’ They answered her by what the Quran has said. Ibrahim then asked, ‘What for have you come?’ They replied, ‘We have come for the destruction of the people of Lot.’ Ibrahim then asked, ‘Will you destroy them even if there are one hundred believing people among them?’ Jibril replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ Ibrahim asked, ‘Will you destroy them if there are fifty believing people among them?’ Jibril replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ He then asked, ‘Will you destroy them if there are thirty believing people among them?’ Jibril replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ Ibrahim then asked, ‘Will you destroy them if there are twenty believing people among them?’ He replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ He then asked, ‘Will you destroy them if there are ten believing people among them?’ He replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ He then asked, ‘Will you destroy them if there are five people among them?’ He replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ He then asked, ‘Will you destroy if there is one believing person among them?’ he replied, ‘No, we will not do so.’ Ibrahim then said, ‘But Lot is there among them.’ They replied, ‘We know more about who is there. We will save him and his family, except his wife, who will be of those who remain behind.’ “Al-Hassan ibn Ali has said, ‘What I know of the story is that Ibrahim tried to save them as it is mentioned in the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, ‘He argued with us about the people of Lot.’ They (angels) came to Lot when he was in a farm near the town. They offered him Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace) and they were wearing turbans. When he saw their good appearance in white dresses and white turbans he asked, ‘Do you want the house?’ They replied, ‘Yes, we want the house.’ He led them and they walked behind him. He then regretted to offer them the house and said, ‘What is it that I have done? I am bringing them to a people whom I know how they are.’ He turned back to them and said, ‘You are coming to the wicked creatures of Allah.’ Jibril said, ‘We are not in a hurry about them until he testifies against them three times’ and he said, ‘This is one.’ He then walked for an hour then turned back to them and said, ‘You are coming to the wicked creatures of Allah.’ Jibril said, ‘These are two testimonies.’ He then walked and when he arrived in the city he turned to them and said, ‘You are coming to the wicked creatures of Allah.’ Jibril said, ‘This is the third testimony.’ He entered and they entered with him until they entered his house. When his wife saw them in good appearance she climbed on the roof and clapped which they did not hear. She then started a fire and when they saw the smoke they came to the door running until they reached at the door and she came down to them and said, ‘There are people with him the like of whom I have never seen in beauty and good appearance.’ They came to the door to enter. When Lot saw them he stood up in front of them and said to them, ‘O my people, have fear of Allah and do not humiliate me before my guests. Is there no man of reason among you?’ He then said, ’These are my daughters and they are more clean for you’; he called them to the lawful matter.’ They said, ‘We have no right on your daughters and you know what we want.’ He said to them, ‘I wish I had enough power against you or a strong support’. Jibril then said, ‘I wish he knew what kind of power he had with him?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘They overwhelmed him and entered the house. Jibril called them aloud to halt and he said, ‘O Lot, allow them to come in. When they came in Jibril pointed his finger to them and they all turned blind as it is mentioned in the words of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, ‘We turned their eyes blind.’ Jibril called him and told him, ‘I am the messenger of your Lord. Their hands will not reach you. Move with your family during a part of the night.’ Jibril then said, ‘We are sent to destroy them.’ He said, ‘O Jibril, do it quickly.’ Jibril said, ‘Their appointed time is in the morning, is the morning not near enough?’ He commanded him and those with him to move away except his wife. He then picked it-the city- with his wing with ten layers of the land, then raised it until those in the heaven above the earth could hear the barking of their dogs, and crowing of their rosters. He then turned it upside down and made it to rain down on it (city) and those around the city with stones of sijjil (baked clay).”’ "

They took their case to Moses and Jibril came to Moses saying, “O Moses, whoever commits fornication one day fornication is committed against him.” He looked at them and said, “Forgive, thus your wives will become chaste.’”” "

The king decided to send a person for a certain task so he asked his judge to find for him a reliable person. The judge said, ‘I do not know anyone more truthful than my brother.’ He called him to go for the task but he did not like it and said to his brother, ‘I am afraid I may lose my wife.’ He insisted and the man could not do anything but to go for the task. He told his brother, ’Brother, of the things that I leave behind no other thing is more important to me than my wife. Please take good care of her in whatever matters she may need.’ His brother agreed and the man left for the task of the king but the woman did not like his leaving. The judge would come and ask her if she needed anything and would provide whatever she needed. He liked her and asked her to yield to his demand but she refused. He swore that if she did not agree he can inform the king that she has committed fornication. She said, ’I cannot yield to your demand and you can do whatever you like.’ He went to the king and said, ’The wife of my brother has committed fornication and it is proved before me.’ The king said, ‘Cleanse her.’ He went to her and said, ‘The king has commanded me to stone you to death. What do you say now? I can stone you to death if you do not agree with what I ask you to do.’ She said, ‘I cannot agree with what you wish, so you can do whatever you like.’ He took her out and placed her in a ditch and stoned, while people were with him. When he thought she was dead he left her and returned. When it became dark in the night and she was still alive she moved out of the ditch and dragged herself on her face out of the city to a monastery where a monk lived. She waited at the door until the morning when the monk opened the door, saw her and asked her about her story. She informed him about it, he felt sympathy for her, took her inside. He had a small son who was his only son in good condition. He treated her injuries until she was cured and gave his son to her to provide him care. The monk had an agent who worked for him. He liked the woman and asked her to yield to his demand but she refused. He tried hard but she did not yield to his demand and he said, ‘If you do not agree I will try to kill you.’ She said, T cannot agree with what you want, so you can do whatever you wish.’ He attacked the child and cut his neck. He went to the monk and said, ‘You entrusted a fornicator who committed fornication. You left your son with her and she has killed him.’ The monk came to her and when he saw him he asked her, ‘What is this? You know I helped you? She informed him of her story and he said, ‘I cannot feel good for you any more if you stay with me; so leave my place? He made her to move away in the night, gave her twenty dirham, told her to spend it and that Allah will sufficiently support her. During the night she left and in the morning she arrived in a town where a man was being crucified, but he was still alive. She asked about his case and they said that he owed twenty dirham which he could not pay. Whoever cannot pay his debts is crucified according to the rules of the town unless he pays it off to his creditor. She took out the twenty dirham, paid to his creditor and asked them to release him. They brought him down from the hanging pole and he said to her, ‘No one has ever done a favor to me greater than what you have done to me. You have saved me from being crucified and from death, thus I must serve you wherever you go? He followed her until they came to the shore and saw a group of people and a ship. He asked her, ‘Stay here so I go work for them to get food for you? He went to them and asked, ‘What does your ship carry?’ They replied, ‘It carries goods for business, like pearls, Ambergris and so on and we use this one for our own ride? He then asked, ‘How much is the value of the goods in your ship?’ They replied, ‘It is a great deal; we cannot count? He then said, ‘I have something with me who is better than what is in your ship? They asked, ‘What is with you?’ he replied, ‘There is a girl with me the like of whom you have never seen? They asked, ‘Do you sell her?’ He replied, ‘Yes, I want to sell her with the condition that one of you come with me to see her, then you can buy her from me and pay without telling her about it until I go away? They said; ‘It is up to you? They sent one of them to look at her and that person said, ‘I have never seen anyone like her in beauty? They bought her from him for ten thousand dirham and paid him. He moved away and when he was far away they came to her and told her to move in the ship. She asked, ‘Why must I move in the ship?’ They replied, ‘We have bought you from your master? She said, ‘He is not my master? They said, ‘Will you move on your own or we carry you in the ship?’ She then walked with them and when they arrived at the shore, they could not trust each other about her, so they kept her in the ship with goods for trading and they themselves stayed in the other ship and set it to sail. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent winds that made all of them drown as well as their ship but she remained safe with the ship loaded with goods for trading until she arrived in an island of the islands of the sea. She tied down the ship and walked on the island, found water, trees and fruits. She said, ‘From this water I will drink and from these fruits I will eat and worship Allah in this place? Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, then sent revelation to a prophet of the prophets of banu Israel to go to that king and tell him, ‘On such and such island there is one of My servants. You and the people in your domain must go to my servant who is there and confess your sins before My servant there then ask that creature to forgive you; if that creature forgives you I will also forgive you? The king along with the people in his dominion went to that island and saw a woman. The king came to her and said, ‘My judge told me that his brother’s wife has committed fornication and I commanded to stone her to death but no testimony was presented before me and I am afraid that I may have done something unlawful and I like that you ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you. Please sit down.’ Then her husband came. He could not recognize her and said, ‘I had a very excellent and virtuous wife but I left her when she did not like and I left her in the care of my brother. When I came back and asked about her, my brother told me that she had committed fornication and he stoned her to death and I am afraid that I may have lost her so ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you’, and she made him to sit next to the king. Then the judge came and said, ‘My brother had a wife who attracted me and I asked her to commit fornication but she refused and I informed the king that she has committed fornication and he commanded me to stone her to death. I stoned her to death and I had lied against her, so please ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you.’ She then turned to her husband and asked him to listen. Then the monk came and told his story and said, ‘I sent her away in the night and I am afraid that wild beasts may have killed her.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven, you please sit down.’ Then the agent of the monk came and told his story and she asked the monk to listen, may Allah forgive you. Then the man, who was to be crucified came and told his story but she said, ‘May Allah not forgive you.’ He (the Imam) said that she then turned to her husband and said, ‘I am your wife and whatever you heard is my story. I do not need any men anymore and I love that you take this ship with its contents and leave me by myself so I can worship Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, on this island. As you have learned how much I have suffered at the hands of men.’ He agreed, took the ship with its contents and allowed her to do what she wanted. The king and people in his dominion returned.’” "

If you like to benefit from her it is lawful for you.’ He then did as he had said and made him responsible for the price of the slave-girl and left. She stayed with him as long as Allah wanted and he satisfied himself in what he wished. Thereafter a messenger of the Khalifah of Amawide came to buy slave-girls for him. She was one of those mentioned to be bought for him. The governor sent a person to him asking about the slave-girl of so and so. He said that so and so is not present. He was forced to sell and paid him with profits for him.

He informed him about what had happened and brought to him all that was paid for her; the price he had set and the extra profit and said, ‘This is the price and this is the profit, so accept it.’ He refused to accept more than the price he had set saying, ‘The extra is for you in good health.
